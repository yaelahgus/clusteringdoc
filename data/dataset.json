{"id": null, "title": "Convicted Bomb Plotter Sentenced to 30 Years", "contents": "PORTLAND, Oregon. \u2013 Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.\u00a0 The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.\u00a0 The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed\u2019s 14-day trial, said \u201cthe intended crime was horrific,\u201d and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, \u201cnever once expressed a change of heart.\u201d\u00a0 King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant \u201cwanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.\u201d\u00a0 King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith today\u2019s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,\u201d said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.\u00a0 \u201cThe evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.\u00a0 Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud\u2019s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.\u00a0 This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.\u00a0 The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.\u201d \u201cThis trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,\u201d said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.\u00a0 \u201cWith the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.\u00a0\u00a0 I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.\u00a0 I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.\u201d\u00a0 According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\u00a0 Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.\u00a0 Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.\u00a0 Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud\u2019s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.\u00a0 In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: \u201cyes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.\u201d\u00a0 Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali\u2019s associate.\u00a0 Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali\u2019s.\u00a0 Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.\u00a0 At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.\u00a0 Mohamud also said that he wanted to become \u201coperational.\u201d\u00a0 Asked what he meant by \u201coperational,\u201d Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.\u00a0 Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland\u2019s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.\u00a0 The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.\u00a0 Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.\u00a0 On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.\u00a0 During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.\u00a0 In response, Mohamud noted, \u201cI want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.\u201d\u00a0 Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.\u00a0 On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.\u00a0 On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\u00a0 Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.\u00a0 The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Oregon.\u00a0 Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077", "date": "2014-10-01T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["National Security Division (NSD)"]}

Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.\u00a0 William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.\u00a0 Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).\u00a0 The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.\u00a0 The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.   \u00a0\u201cThe resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.\u00a0 \u201cThe court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.\u00a0 By enforcing the nation\u2019s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.\u201d   \u201cThis office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Walker.   \u201cThis case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,\u201d said Director McLeod.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public\u2019s health at risk.\u201d   \u00a0\u201cThe Waccamaw is unique and wild,\u201d said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. \u201cIts watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.\u00a0 We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.\u201d   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder\u2019s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.\u00a0 Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.\u00a0 The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.\u00a0 Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder\u2019s Branch.\u00a0   The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.\u00a0   The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.\u00a0 The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J.

{"id": "11-1002", "title": "$1 Million Settlement Reached for Natural Resource Damages at Superfund Site in Massachusetts", "contents": "      BOSTON\u2013 A $1-million settlement has been reached for natural resource damages (NRD) at the Blackburn & Union Privileges Superfund Site in Walpole, Mass., the Departments of Justice and Interior (DOI), and the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General announced today.        \u00a0       The Blackburn & Union Privileges Superfund Site includes 22 acres of contaminated land and water in Walpole. The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.        \u00a0       The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace & Co.\u2013 Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.       \u00a0       From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.       \u00a0       In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.       \u00a0       \u201cThis settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,\u201d said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.       \u00a0       \u201cThe citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,\u201d Attorney General Martha Coakley said. \u201cWe are pleased that today\u2019s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.\u201d         \u00a0       The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).       \u00a0       In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS\u2019s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth\u2019s assessment costs.       \u201cThis settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.\u00a0 I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,\u201d said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth\u2019s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       \u201cThis settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,\u201d said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. \u201cWe look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.\u201d\u00a0\u201cMore than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,\u201d said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. \u201cWe will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.\u201d        \u00a0       Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site.

{"id": "10-015", "title": "10 Las Vegas Men Indicted \r\nfor Falsifying Vehicle Emissions Tests", "contents": "  WASHINGTON\u2014A federal grand jury in Las Vegas today returned indictments against 10 Nevada-certified emissions testers for falsifying vehicle emissions test reports, the Justice Department announced.   Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:\u00a0    Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle\u2019s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle\u2019s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.\u00a0    \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department\u2019s Environmental Crimes Section.", "date": "2010-01-08T00:00:00-05:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Environment and Natural Resources Division"]}

Wood for the Justice Department's\u00a0Environment and Natural Resources Division . \u201cToday\u2019s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.\u201d \u201cThis settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,\u201d said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. \u201cThe Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.\u201d \u201cSuccessfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,\u201d said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. \u201cWe are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.\u201d \u201cWe are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,\u201d said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. \u201cThe settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.\u201d The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State\u2019s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.\u00a0 Under the settlement, Emhart and Black & Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black & Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart\u2019s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.\u00a0 The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

{"id": "14-1412", "title": "14 Indicted in Connection with New England Compounding Center and Nationwide Fungal Meningitis Outbreak", "contents": "A 131-count criminal indictment was unsealed today in Boston in connection with the 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak, the Justice Department announced.\u00a0 Barry J. Cadden, owner and head pharmacist of New England Compounding Center (NECC) and NECC\u2019s supervisory pharmacist Glenn A. Chin were charged with 25 acts of second-degree murder in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The outbreak was caused by contaminated vials of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) manufactured by NECC, located in Framingham, Massachusetts.\u00a0 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 751 patients in 20 states were diagnosed with a fungal infection after receiving injections of NECC\u2019s MPA.\u00a0 Of those 751 patients, the CDC reported that 64 patients in nine states died.\u00a0 Twelve other individuals, all associated with NECC, including six other pharmacists, the director of operations, the national sales director, an unlicensed pharmacy technician, two of NECC\u2019s owners, and one other individual were charged with additional crimes including racketeering, mail fraud, conspiracy, contempt, structuring, and violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. \u201cAs alleged in the indictment,\u00a0these employees\u00a0knew\u00a0they were\u00a0producing their medication\u00a0in an unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions, and authorized it to be shipped out anyway, with fatal results,\u201d said Attorney General Eric Holder.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWith\u00a0the indictment and these arrests, the Department of Justice is taking decisive action to hold\u00a0these\u00a0individuals accountable for their alleged participation in grievous wrongdoing.\u00a0 Actions like the ones alleged in this case display not only a reckless disregard for health and safety regulations, but also an extreme and appalling indifference to human life.\u00a0 American consumers have a right to know that their medications are safe to use, and this case proves that the Department of Justice will always stand resolute to ensure that right, to protect the American people, and to hold wrongdoers accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d \u201cEvery patient receiving treatment deserves the peace of mind and knowledge that the medicine they are receiving is safe,\u201d said Acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery.\u00a0 \u201cWhen people and companies violate that trust and break the law, the consequences to patients and their families can be catastrophic.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it remains a priority of the Department to use every tool at our disposal to protect patients\u2019 safety and hold bad actors accountable.\u201d \u201cThose who produce and sell the drugs that we take have a special responsibility to make sure that they prepare those drugs under suitable conditions, and that what leaves their facilities is safe,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Joyce R. Branda for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.\u00a0 \u201cThe indictment charges that the defendants\u2019 conduct in this case was corrupt and carried out with a complete disregard to the public\u2019s health.\u00a0 The department\u2018s Consumer Protection Branch along with our law enforcement partners is steadfast in our commitment to use every criminal and civil tool at our disposal to hold accountable those who are willing to put our lives at risk in the reckless pursuit of their profits.\u201d \u201cEver since the outbreak occurred, we have been committed to bringing to justice the individuals responsible for the deaths and suffering of so many innocent victims,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz for the District of Massachusetts.\u00a0 \u201cThe indictment announced today is the first step in that process which addresses alleged criminal wrongdoing at NECC, a business that prioritized production and profit over safety.\u00a0 We will make every effort to ensure that licensed pharmacists, and those working with them, are held to a standard of care that protects the public from unsafe and dangerous medications.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTwo years after the fungal meningitis outbreak, our hearts continue to go out to the victims of this tragedy and to their families,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg M.D.\u00a0 \u201cOur work on behalf of all patients who want and deserve medicines that do not subject them to undue risk is far from done.\u00a0 The FDA will continue to work aggressively on many fronts with the states, the Department of Justice, and others to protect the American public from unsafe compounded drug products.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThreats to public health, as alleged in today's indictment, are a priority for the FBI,\u201d said Assistant Director Joseph S. Campbell of the FBI\u2019s Criminal Division.\u00a0 \u201cTogether with our law enforcement and regulatory agency partners, we are determined to stop practices that jeopardize patients' health and violate the public trust.\u00a0 These types of investigations are complex and resource intensive.\u00a0 We greatly appreciate the efforts of our partners in this case and look forward to working with them to effectively identify criminal activities and combat fraudulent and abusive health practices in the future.\u201d The 14 individuals charged in the indictment are Barry J. Cadden, 48, of Wrentham, Massachusetts; Glenn A. Chin, 46, of Canton, Massachusetts; Gene Svirskiy, 33, of Ashland, Massachusetts; Christopher M. Leary, 30, of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts; Joseph M. Evanosky, 42, of Westford, Massachusetts; Scott M. Connolly, 42, of East Greenwich, Rhode Island; Sharon P. Carter, 50, of Hopkinton, Massachusetts; Alla V. Stepanets, 34, of Framingham, Massachusetts; Gregory A. Conigliaro, 49 of Southborough, Massachusetts; Robert A. Ronzio, 40, of North Providence, Rhode Island; Kathy Chin, 42, of Canton, Massachusetts; Michelle Thomas, 31 of Cumberland, Rhode Island; Carla Conigliaro, 51, of Dedham, Massachusetts and Douglas A. Conigliaro, 53, of Dedham, Massachusetts.\u00a0\u00a0 The 25 second-degree murders are included in the indictment as predicate racketeering acts under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\u00a0 These charges relate to patients who received NECC MPA and died in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. As a general matter, and depending on particular state law, second-degree murder does not require the government to prove Cadden and Chin had specific intent to kill the 25 patients, but rather that Cadden and Chin acted with extreme indifference to human life.\u00a0 According to the indictment, Cadden and Chin knew that NECC was making MPA in a manner and in an environment in which they could not assure that the drug was sterile as it was identified to be.\u00a0 Despite knowing that they were making the MPA in an unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions, Cadden and Chin nonetheless allegedly directed and authorized the shipping of MPA to NECC customers nationwide.\u00a0 It is alleged that Cadden and Chin were aware that doctors would inject MPA into their patients\u2019 bodies, and that if the MPA was not in fact sterile, it could kill them.\u00a0 The 25 murder racketeering acts comprise only a portion of the broad racketeering scheme charged in the indictment.\u00a0 The indictment also alleges that NECC\u2019s other pharmacists knowingly made and sold numerous drugs in a similar unsafe manner and in insanitary conditions.\u00a0 The unsafe manner alleged in the indictment includes, among other things, the pharmacists\u2019 failure to properly sterilize NECC\u2019s drugs, failure to properly test NECC\u2019s drugs for sterility, and failure to wait for test results before sending the drugs to customers.\u00a0 The insanitary conditions alleged in the indictment include, among other things, NECC\u2019s lack of proper cleaning and NECC\u2019s failure to take any action when its own environmental monitoring repeatedly detected mold and bacteria within NECC\u2019s clean room suite of rooms throughout 2012.\u00a0 It is further alleged that NECC repeatedly took steps to shield its operations from regulatory oversight by the FDA by claiming to be a pharmacy dispensing drugs pursuant to valid, patient-specific prescriptions.\u00a0 In fact, NECC routinely dispensed drugs in bulk without valid prescriptions.\u00a0 The indictment alleges that NECC even used fictional and celebrity names on fake prescriptions to dispense drugs.\u00a0 Finally, the indictment charges Carla Conigliaro, the majority shareholder of NECC, and her husband Douglas Conigliaro with transferring assets following the fungal meningitis outbreak.\u00a0 Specifically, the indictment charges that after NECC declared bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court ordered the shareholders not to transfer assets, Carla and Doug Conigliaro transferred approximately $33.3 million to eight different bank accounts opened after the NECC bankruptcy.\u00a0 Cadden and Chin face a maximum of up to life in prison if convicted on all counts.\u00a0 \u201cAlthough no VA patients were affected by the fungal meningitis outbreak, VA unknowingly purchased a variety of pharmaceutical products over a three year period from NECC that were intentionally produced in an unsafe manner under insanitary conditions,\u201d said Assistant Inspector General for Investigations James J. O\u2019Neill for the Office of Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs.\u00a0 \u201cWe are pleased to have contributed to this outstanding multi-agency criminal investigation.\u201d \u201cToday's results are part of an ongoing effort by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the Department of Defense's health care program and the quality of care our service members receive,\u201d said Deputy Inspector General for Investigations James B. Burch for the U.S. Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General.\u00a0 \u201cThe Defense Criminal Investigative Service will continue to pursue allegations of health care fraud that put the Warfighter at risk.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service is pleased to join our federal partners in this announcement\u201d said Postal Inspector in Charge Shelly A. Binkowski of the Boston Division.\u00a0 \u201cWhat's particularly disturbing about this case is that through their alleged misrepresentation and greed, these defendants put the health and well-being of others at a high level of risk.\u00a0 This criminal action today demonstrates the commitment and vigilance of postal inspectors and other federal agents to pursue criminals who prey on the public in such an egregious way.\u201d In announcing the indictment today, Attorney General Holder and U.S. Attorney Ortiz acknowledged the assistance and cooperation of Michigan State Attorney General Bill Schuette.\u00a0 The state of Michigan had the most deaths during the outbreak. The investigation was conducted by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations and the FBI with assistance by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General; Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys George P. Varghese and Amanda P.M. Strachan of the Health Care Fraud Unit for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the District of Massachusetts, and Trial Attorney John W.M. Claud of the Civil Division\u2019s Consumer Protection Branch. The details contained in the indictment are allegations.\u00a0 The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Arrest warrants have been issued  for the remaining defendants, who will make their initial appearances in federal  court in the districts in which they are arrested.   \u00a0   According to  the indictments, from at least July 2008 through April 2014, conspirators in the  mainland United States and in Puerto Rico sold the identities and corresponding  Social Security cards, Puerto Rico birth certificates and other identification  documents of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens to undocumented aliens and others  residing in the mainland United States.   \u00a0   Specifically, the indictments allege that individuals located in  the Caguas, Rio Piedras and San Juan areas of Puerto Rico (suppliers) obtained  Puerto Rican identities and corresponding identity documents, and conspirators  in various locations in the United States (identity brokers) solicited customers  for those identities and documents.   The  identity brokers allegedly sold the identities and documents to the customers  for prices ranging from $700 to $2,500 per set of Social Security cards and  corresponding Puerto Rico birth certificates.   \u00a0   According to  the indictment, the identity brokers ordered the identity documents from the  suppliers by making coded telephone calls, including using terms such as  \u201cshirts,\u201d \u201cuniforms\u201d or \u201cclothes\u201d to refer to identity documents.   The suppliers generally requested that the  identity brokers send payment for the documents through a money transfer service  to names provided by the suppliers.   The  conspirators frequently confirmed payee names and addresses, money transfer  control numbers and trafficked identities via text messaging.   The suppliers allegedly retrieved the  payments from the money transfer service and sent the identity documents to the  brokers using express, priority or regular U.S. Mail.   \u00a0   According to  the indictments, once the identity brokers received the identity documents, they  delivered the documents to the customers and obtained the remaining payment from  the customers.   The brokers generally  kept the second payment for themselves as profit.   Some identity brokers allegedly assumed a  Puerto Rican identity themselves and used that identity in connection with the  trafficking operation.   \u00a0   As alleged  in the indictments, the customers generally obtained the identity documents to  assume the identity of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens and obtain additional  identification documents, such as state driver\u2019s licenses.   Some customers allegedly obtained the  documents to commit financial fraud and others attempted to obtain U.S.  passports.   The  indictments alleges that various identity brokers were operating in  Indianapolis,   Columbus and Seymour,  Indiana; Aurora, Illinois; Bartow, Florida; Lawrenceville, Jonesboro and  Norcross, Georgia; Salisbury, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; Lawrence and  Springfield, Massachusetts; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;  Houston, Texas; Guymon, Oklahoma; Huron, South Dakota and Albertville, Alabama.   \u00a0   The charges  announced today are the result of Operation Island Express II, an ongoing,  nationally-coordinated investigation led by the ICE-HSI Chicago Office and  USPIS, DSS and IRS-CID offices in Chicago, in coordination with the ICE-HSI San  Juan Office.   The Illinois Secretary of  State Police provided substantial assistance.    The ICE-HSI Attach\u00e9 office in the Dominican Republic, National Drug  Intelligence Center - Document and Media Exploitation Branch and International  Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2) provided invaluable  assistance, as well as various ICE, USPIS, DSS and IRS CI offices around the  country.   \u00a0   The case is  being prosecuted by the Criminal Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section,  with the assistance of the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special  Prosecution Section, and the support of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the  District of Puerto Rico.   \u00a0   Anyone who  believes that their identity may have been compromised by the crimes that are  the subject of to this investigation may contact the ICE toll-free hotline at  1-866-DHS-2ICE (1-866-347-2423) and its online tip form at    www.ice.gov/tipline .

{"id": "14-660", "title": "168 Juveniles Recovered in Nationwide Operation Targeting Commercial Child Sex Trafficking", "contents": "  During the past week, the FBI, its local, state, and federal law enforcement  partners, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)  conducted Operation Cross Country VIII, a week-long enforcement action to  address commercial child sex trafficking throughout the United States.  This operation included enforcement actions in  106 cities across 54 FBI field divisions nationwide and resulted in 168  recoveries of children who were being victimized through prostitution.  Additionally, 281 pimps were arrested on state  and federal charges.   \u201cChild sex traffickers  create a living nightmare for their adolescent victims,\u201d said Leslie R.  Caldwell, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department  of Justice.  \u201cThey use fear and force and treat children as commodities of sex  to be sold again and again.  This operation puts traffickers behind bars and  rescues kids from their nightmare so they can start reclaiming their  childhood.\u201d\u201cTargeting and harming America\u2019s children through  commercial sex trafficking is a heinous crime, with serious consequences.\u201d said  FBI Director James B. Comey.  \u201cEvery child deserves to be safe and sound.  Through targeted measures like Operation Cross  Country, we can end the cycle of victimization.\u201dOperation Cross Country  is part of the Innocence Lost National Initiative that was established in 2003  by the FBI\u2019s Criminal Investigative Division, in partnership with the Department  of Justice and NCMEC, to address the growing problem of child  prostitution.\u201cOperation Cross Country reveals that children are being  targeted and sold for sex in America every day,\u201d said John Ryan, President and  CEO of NCMEC.  \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner  with the FBI and provide support to both law enforcement and victim specialists  in the field as they help survivors take that first step toward  freedom.\u201dTo date, the FBI and its task force partners have recovered  nearly 3,600 children from the streets.  The investigations and subsequent 1,450  convictions have resulted in lengthy sentences, including 14 life terms and the  seizure of more than $3.1 million in assets.Task force operations  usually begin as local enforcement actions that target truck stops, casinos,  street \u201ctracks,\u201d and websites that advertise dating or escort services, based on  intelligence gathered by officers working in their respective jurisdictions.   Initial arrests are often violations of  local and state laws relating to prostitution or solicitation.  Information gleaned from those arrested  frequently uncovers organized efforts to prostitute women and children across  many states.  FBI agents further develop  this evidence in partnership with U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices and the U.S.  Department of Justice\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section so that  prosecutors can help bring federal charges in those cities where child  prostitution occurs.The Innocence Lost National Initiative partners with  NCMEC to provide training for state and federal law enforcement agencies,  prosecutors and social service providers from across the country.The FBI  thanks its local, state, and federal law enforcement partners representing 392  separate agencies for their ongoing enforcement efforts, and participation in  Operation Cross Country VIII.The following list denotes FBI divisions,  not necessarily actual cities, where juveniles were recovered and pimps were  arrested.   \u00a0   \u00a0  FBI Division  Juveniles Recovered  Pimps Arrested   Albany   0   Albuquerque   0   0   Anchorage   0   3   Atlanta   11   15   Baltimore   2   5   Birmingham   1   3   Boston   0   0   Buffalo   2   0   Charlotte   0   3   Chicago   13   4   Cincinnati   0   1   Cleveland   16   12   Columbia   1   2   Dallas   2   2   Denver   18   11   Detroit   5   6   El Paso   0   1   Houston   4   4   Indianapolis   4   3   Jackson   2   19   Jacksonville   0   1   Kansas City   2   7   Knoxville   0   1   Las Vegas   7   2   Little Rock   2   5   Los Angeles   10   12   Louisville   0   4   Memphis   2   5   Miami   3   4   Milwaukee   6   12   Minneapolis   1   9   Mobile   0   0   Newark   1   8   New Haven   1   1   New Orleans   3   17   New York   3   3   Norfolk   0   1   Oklahoma City   2   14   Omaha   1   2   Philadelphia   0   2   Phoenix   5   21   Pittsburgh   0   3   Portland   1   2   Richmond   0   2   Sacramento   9   7   Salt Lake City   0   0   San Antonio   6   3   San Diego   2   6   San Francisco   6   13   Seattle   4   13   Springfield   2   1   St. Louis   0   1   Tampa   8   3   WFO   0   2  Total   168   281   \u00a0    ", "date": "2014-06-23T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Criminal Division"]}
{"id": "09-176", "title": "17 Members and Associates of Violent Gang Indicted", "contents": "  WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal grand jury in Lubbock, Texas, has charged 17 members and associates of the violent gang known as the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (ALKQN) with various charges related to their alleged narcotics and weapons trafficking violations, a well as a variety of alleged violent crimes throughout Texas, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division Rita M. Glavin and Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas James T. Jacks announced today.   Four of the 17 defendants were arrested last night and today in Lubbock, Midland, Big Spring, and Mission, Texas, as well as in Chicago. Eleven defendants are already in federal or state custody on related and unrelated charges. Two are considered fugitives. The defendants arrested today will make their initial appearance in Abilene, Texas, before U.S. Magistrate Philip R. Lane, on Friday, Feb. 27, 2009.   The 11-count indictment, returned earlier this month and unsealed today, charges each of the defendants with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. Three defendants are also charged with conspiring to deal in firearms. The indictment also includes drug distribution charges and various firearms charges, including using and carrying a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.   \"The message this indictment sends not just to these defendants but to those who support and participate in gangs is that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners at the federal, state and local level, we will work tirelessly to protect our communities and punish those who seek to corrupt them through violence and gun and drug trafficking,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division Rita M. Glavin.   Acting U.S. Attorney Jacks said, \"Regardless of what dramatic name they attached to their group, criminal gangs are just that \u2013 criminals. Like most criminals, their illegal activities of drug dealing and engaging in violent crime are a cancer on our communities; communities comprised of honest, hard working people who are simply trying to earn a living, raise their families and live in peace. As evidenced by this action, law enforcement is committed to removing that cancer through determined investigative effort and the cooperation of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies as was done in this case. All of these agencies, with the help and support of the community, will continue to pursue these groups until they are no longer a part of our environment.\"   The defendants arrested today are:   Eliseo Perez, a/k/a Wicked, 28, of Mission, Texas was arrested Wednesday night.   Defendants indicted but not yet arrested are:   The indictment alleges that from 2001 until Dec. 13, 2008, when six of the defendants were arrested, the defendants, as members of the ALKQN, conspired to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine and marijuana throughout Texas and elsewhere. They acquired, packaged, stored, and transported the cocaine and marijuana, and according to court documents filed in the case, imported the narcotics from Mexico into the South Texas region, and then on to Big Spring, Lubbock, and Midland for further distribution. In furtherance of their conspiracy, one or more of the defendants is alleged to have committed numerous acts of violence, including murder, aggravated assault and arson.   During part of the time of the conspiracy, from 2004 through mid-July 2005, defendants Jose Robledo Nava, Jesus Martinez, and Hiluterio Chavez are alleged to have conspired to deal in firearms. They allegedly acquired the firearms, stored and transported them, and traded them for cocaine. Court documents filed in the case allege that the defendants illegally transported and trafficked the firearms throughout Texas and Chicago.   Jose Robledo Nava is allegedly the ALKQN leader in Texas. He, along with James Johnathan Cole, Robert Allen Ramirez, Gabriel Lee Gonzales and Eduardo Daniel Mares are charged in the indictment with the May 4, 2008, murders of Valerie Garcia and Michael Cardona, in Big Spring.   According to an affidavit supporting a criminal complaint filed in the case, on May 4, 2008, Jose Nava allegedly directed James Cole and Robert Ramirez to go in two vehicles to conduct a drive-by shooting on their rivals. Robert Ramirez was to be the passenger in the lead vehicle to confirm the targets, and James Johnathan Cole, armed with an AK-47, was to be the shooter in the following vehicle, which was to be driven by Gabriel Lee Gonzales.   With Ramirez and Eduardo Daniel Mares in the lead vehicle and Cole and Gonzales following in the second vehicle, after Ramirez and Mares passed the house of the rival gang members, Ramirez allegedly called Gonzales\u2019 cell phone and conveyed Jose Nava\u2019s previous order to him. The shooter fired into a crowd of people, striking six persons, including a pregnant woman and a three-year-old girl. Two of those victims, the pregnant woman and one of three men shot, died of their wounds.   The affidavit states that Ramirez, Mares, Cole and Gonzales then allegedly drove the two vehicles to a body shop where Cole retrieved the spent AK-47 shell casings and discarded them. Cole, Ramirez and Mares then drove to a fellow ALKQN residence where Cole admitted shooting the AK-47 and killing at least one person at the residence where the narcotics trafficking rivals were located.   An indictment is merely an accusation by a federal grand jury and a defendant is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless proven guilty. However, if convicted, defendants Nava, Cole, Ramirez, Gonzales and Mares each face a maximum statutory sentence of death or life in prison. The remaining defendants face a maximum statutory sentence of life in prison and a fine of up to $4 million.   While stating the investigation is ongoing, acting U.S. Attorney Jacks praised the excellent investigative efforts of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, the Midland and El Paso U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices, DEA, FBI, ICE, ATF, U.S. Marshals Service, Texas Department of Public Safety, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Midland Police Department, Houston Police Department, Big Spring Police Department, and the Howard County District Attorney\u2019s Office.

The superseding indictment included a conspiracy charge to defraud the United States involving a scheme to use stolen Puerto Rican identities to file tax returns and obtain fraudulent income tax refunds.   A number of the defendants had previously been charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, cocaine distribution and international money laundering.         \u00a0       To accomplish their tax refund scheme, the indictment alleges that the conspirators fabricated individual income tax returns using stolen personal identification information from residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The defendants obtained laptop computers that contained over 2,600 stolen identities.  The laptops also identified $19 million in fraudulent refund claims.  The addresses used on some of the false tax returns were obtained by stealing mail from mailboxes in and around Anchorage.   In other cases, it is alleged that one or more of the defendants contacted conspirators in locations such as New Jersey and Puerto Rico and requested that fraudulently obtained tax refund checks be sent to Anchorage using false names.   The indictment further alleges that the conspirators negotiated refund checks in Anchorage with the help of corrupt bank employees.

continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify, deter, and keep the most sensitive U.S. origin goods and technology out of the most dangerous hands.\u201d \u00a0 Shih, an electrical engineer who is a part-time Los Angeles resident and a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Taiwan, and Mai who resides in Pasadena, California and is a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Vietnam, were arrested on Jan. 19, without incident by federal agents. \u00a0 Shih and Mai, who previously worked together at two different companies, are named in a criminal complaint unsealed on Jan. 19, that charges them with conspiracy. \u00a0Shih is also charged with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a federal law that makes illegal, among other things, certain unauthorized exports. \u00a0 The complaint alleges that Shih and Mai conspired to illegally provide Shih with unauthorized access to a protected computer of a U.S. company that manufactured specialized, high-speed computer chips known as monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). \u00a0The conspiracy count also alleges that the two men engaged in mail fraud, wire fraud and international money laundering to further the scheme. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  According to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, Shih and Mai executed a scheme to defraud the U.S. company out of its proprietary, export-controlled items, including technology associated with its design services for MMICs. \u00a0As part of the scheme, Shih and Mai accessed the victim company\u2019s computer systems via its web portal after Mai obtained that access by posing as a domestic customer seeking to obtain custom-designed MMICs that would be used solely in the United States. \u00a0Shih and Mail allegedly concealed Shih\u2019s true intent to transfer the U.S. company\u2019s technology and products to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u00a0 The victim company\u2019s proprietary semiconductor technology has a number of commercial and military applications, and its customers include the Air Force, Navy and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. \u00a0MMICs are used in electronic warfare, electronic warfare countermeasures and radar applications. \u00a0 The computer chips at the heart of this case allegedly were shipped to Chengdu GaStone Technology Company (CGTC), a Chinese company that established a MMIC manufacturing facility in Chengdu. \u00a0Shih was the president of CGTC, which in 2014 was placed on the Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List, according to the affidavit, \u201cdue to its involvement in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interest of the United States \u2013 specifically, that it had been involved in the illicit procurement of commodities and technologies for unauthorized military end use in China.\u201d \u00a0Because it was on the Entity List, a license from the Commerce Department was required to export U.S.-origin MMICs to CGTC, and there was a \u201cpresumption of denial\u201d of a license. \u00a0 The complaint outlines a scheme in which Shih used a Los Angeles-based company he controlled \u2013 Pullman Lane Productions, LLC \u2013 to funnel funds provided by Chinese entities to finance the manufacturing of MMICs by the victim company. \u00a0The complaint affidavit alleges that Pullman Lane received financing from a Beijing-based company that was placed on the Entity List the same day as CGTC \u201con the basis of its involvement in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.\u201d \u00a0 Mai acted as the middleman by using his Los Angeles company \u2013 MicroEx Engineering \u2013 to pose as a legitimate domestic customer that ordered and paid for the manufacturing of MMICs that Shih illegally exported to CGTC in China, according to the complaint. \u00a0It is the export of the MMICs that forms the basis of the IEEPA violation alleged against Shih. \u00a0The specific exported MMICs also required a license from the Commerce Department before being exported to China, and a license was never sought or obtained for this export. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Shih and Mai are expected to made their first court appearances on Jan. 19, in U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles. \u00a0 The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\u00a0 If convicted, Mai faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and Shih faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.\u00a0 The maximum statutory sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes. If convicted of any offense, the sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. \u00a0 This case is being investigated by the FBI; the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement; and IRS Criminal Investigation. \u00a0 This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Judith A.

The conference provided participants with an overview of the federal animal welfare and cruelty statutes, investigation techniques, and strategies to overcome prosecution challenges. The Humane Society of the United States, along with prosecutors and federal agents, shared their experience in handling dog fighting and animal cruelty cases strengthening the response to these serious crimes. \u00a0 \u201cFighting contests involving dogs and other animals are morally wrong and illegal, said United States Attorney Charles E. Peeler.\u201d They also create havens for additional illegal conduct such as gambling, drug trade and unlawful gun possession.\u00a0 Our office works with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute those involved in this reprehensible conduct.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cEnding animal fighting ventures and other inhumane practices will require a close partnership among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood of the Justice Department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division. \u201cOur Division is proud to be a leader in this worthy cause and to participate in this important training event in the wonderful city of Valdosta, Georgia.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThe USDA OIG is pleased to have worked closely with the Department of Justice to coordinate this important training initiative to combat animal fighting and the associated crimes which often occur in animal fighting ventures,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Karen Citizen-Wilcox for the USDA OIG Southeast Region Office of Investigations. \u201cSpecial Agents from all of the OIG\u2019s regional offices will share their knowledge of and experiences with animal fighting investigations with personnel attending from other law enforcement agencies and private organizations.\u201d \u00a0 During the training, animal fighting investigators from the Humane Society of the United States, along with prosecutors and USDA OIG agents who have successfully investigated and prosecuted animal fighting cases, shared their experiences with attendees. Instructors provided participants with an overview of the business of dog fighting, a description of federal animal welfare and cruelty statutes, effective investigative techniques, evidence collection best practices, available resources and authorities for the seizure and post-seizure care of animals and successful sentencing strategies. \u00a0 State and national animal control associations estimate that upwards of 40,000 people participate in dog fighting in the United States at a professional level, meaning that dog fighting and its associated gambling are their primary or only source of income. An unknown but potentially larger number of people participate in dog fighting on an occasional basis. Cockfighting is thought to be similarly widespread. In addition, animal fighting activities attract other serious crimes, such as gambling, drug dealing, weapons offenses and money laundering. Children are commonly present at animal fighting events. \u00a0 The federal Animal Welfare Act makes it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any animal, including dogs, for purposes of having the animal participate in an animal fighting venture. In 2014, the Department of Justice designated the Environment and Natural Resources Division as the centralized body within the Department responsible for tracking, coordinating, and working with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices on animal cruelty enforcement matters.", "date": "2017-12-14T00:00:00-05:00", "topics": ["Environment"], "components": ["Environment and Natural Resources Division", "USAO - Georgia, Middle"]}

Fishman for the District of New Jersey announced. The defendants (see chart below) were arrested\u00a0in New Jersey and Washington\u00a0by special agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and charged in 14 complaints with conspiracy to commit visa fraud, conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit and other offenses. \u00a0All the defendants, with the exception of Yanjun Lin aka Aimee Lin, 25, of Flushing, New York, will appear today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven C. Mannion of the District of New Jersey in Newark, New Jersey, federal court.\u00a0 Lin will appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen L. Strombom in the Western District of Washington federal court. \u201c\u2018Pay to Stay\u2019 schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs, they also pose a very real threat to national security,\u201d U.S. Attorney Fishman said. \u00a0\u201cToday\u2019s arrests, which were made possible by the great undercover work of our law enforcement partners, stopped 21 brokers, recruiters and employers across multiple states who recklessly exploited our immigration system for financial gain.\u201d \u201cWhile the United States fully supports international education, we will vigorously investigate those who seek to exploit the U.S. immigration system,\u201d said Director Sarah R. Salda\u00f1a for ICE. \u00a0\u201cAs a result of this operation, HSI special agents have successfully identified and closed a gap in the student visa system and have arrested 21 individuals alleged to be amongst the system\u2019s most egregious violators.\u201d \u201cIndividuals engaged in schemes that would undermine the remarkable educational opportunities afforded to international students represent an affront to those who play by the rules,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Terence S. Opiola for ICE Homeland Security Investigations.\u00a0 \u201cThese unscrupulous individuals undermine the integrity of the immigration system.\u00a0 Our special agents are committed to addressing, identifying fraud in order to better protect the system as a whole.\u201d According to the complaints unsealed today and statements made in court: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The defendants, many of whom operated recruiting companies for purported international students, were arrested for their involvement in an alleged scheme to enroll foreign nationals as students in the University of Northern New Jersey, a purported for-profit college located in Cranford, New Jersey (UNNJ). \u00a0Unbeknownst to the defendants and the foreign nationals they conspired with, however, the UNNJ was created in September 2013 by HSI federal agents. Through the UNNJ, undercover HSI agents investigated criminal activities associated with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), including, but not limited to, student visa fraud and the harboring of aliens for profit.\u00a0 The UNNJ was not staffed with instructors or educators, had no curriculum and conducted no actual classes or education activities. \u00a0The UNNJ operated solely as a storefront location with small offices staffed by federal agents posing as school administrators. UNNJ represented itself as a school that, among other things, was authorized to issue a document known as a \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status - for Academic and Language Students,\u201d commonly referred to as a Form I-20.\u00a0 This document, which certifies that a foreign national has been accepted to a school and would be a full-time student, typically enables legitimate foreign students to obtain an F-1 student visa.\u00a0 The F-1 student visa allows a foreign student to enter and/or remain in the United States while the student makes normal progress toward the completion of a full course of study in an SEVP accredited institution.\u00a0 During the investigation, HSI special agents identified hundreds of foreign nationals, primarily from China and India, who previously entered the U.S. on F-1 non-immigrant student visas to attend other SEVP- accredited schools.\u00a0 Through various recruiting companies and business entities located in New Jersey, California, Illinois, New York and Virginia, the defendants then enabled approximately 1,076 of these foreign individuals \u2013 all of whom were willing participants in the scheme \u2013 to fraudulently maintain their nonimmigrant status in the U.S. on the false pretense that they continued to participate in full courses of study at the UNNJ.\u00a0 Acting as recruiters, the defendants solicited the involvement of UNNJ administrators to participate in the scheme. \u00a0During the course of their dealings with undercover agents, the defendants fully acknowledged that none of their foreign national clients would attend any actual courses, earn actual credits, or make academic progress toward an actual degree in a particular field of study.\u00a0 Rather, the defendants facilitated the enrollment of their foreign national clients in UNNJ to fraudulently maintain student visa status, in exchange for kickbacks, or \u201ccommissions.\u201d\u00a0 The defendants also facilitated the creation of hundreds of false student records, including transcripts, attendance records and diplomas, which were purchased by their foreign national conspirators for the purpose of deceiving immigration authorities.\u00a0 In other instances, the defendants used UNNJ to fraudulently obtain work authorization and work visas for hundreds of their clients.\u00a0 By obtaining this authorization, a number of defendants were able to outsource their foreign national clients as full-time employees with numerous U.S.-based corporations, also in exchange for commission fees.\u00a0 Other defendants devised phony IT projects that were\u00a0purportedly to occur at the school.\u00a0 These defendants then created and caused to be created false contracts, employment verification letters, transcripts and other documents.\u00a0 The defendants then paid the undercover agents thousands of dollars to put the school\u2019s letterhead on the sham documents, to sign the documents as school administrators and to otherwise go along with the scheme.\u00a0 All of these bogus documents created the illusion that prospective foreign workers would be working at the school in some IT capacity or project.\u00a0 The defendants then used these fictitious documents fraudulently to obtain labor certifications issued by the U.S. Secretary of Labor and then ultimately to petition the U.S. government to obtain H1-B visas for non-immigrants.\u00a0 These fictitious documents were then submitted to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS).\u00a0 In the vast majority of circumstances, the foreign worker visas were not issued because USCIS was advised of the ongoing undercover operation. In addition, starting today, HSI Newark is coordinating with the ICE Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU) and the SEVP to terminate the nonimmigrant student status for the foreign nationals associated with UNNJ, and if applicable, administratively arrest and place them into removal proceedings. The chart below outlines the charges for each defendant. \u00a0The charges of conspiracy to commit visa fraud and making a false statement each carry a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \u00a0The charges of conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit and H1-B Visa fraud each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine. The charges and allegations contained in the complaints are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

That\u2019s why I have ordered our drug trafficking task forces to use every law available to arrest, prosecute, convict, and defund MS-13. And we are getting results. So far this year, we have secured convictions against more than\u00a01,200\u00a0gang members and worked with our partners in Central America to arrest and charge some 4,000 MS-13 members. \u00a0I want to thank the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0our federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and the Criminal Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section as well as\u00a0Treasury,\u00a0BOP, DOJ\u2019s OCDETF task force members, and all of our state and local law enforcement partners for their hard work. These 267 arrests are the next step toward making this country safer by taking MS-13 off of our streets for good.\u201d\n\u201cMS-13 has long been a priority for ICE. However we are now combating the gang with renewed focus and an unprecedented level of cooperation among DHS\u2019s components and our domestic and international partners,\u201d said Thomas Homan, ICE Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director. \u201cICE has the ability to pursue complex criminal cases using our statutory authorities and to prevent crime by using our administrative arrest authorities to remove gang members from the country. We will not rest until every member, associate, and leader of MS-13 has been held accountable for their crimes, and those in this country illegally have been removed.\u201d\nThe operation was conducted in two phases, targeting dangerous gang members and their global financial networks. The first phase of the operation which was announced previously, netted 53 arrests in El Salvador at the conclusion of an 18-month investigation in September. The second phase was conducted across the United States from Oct. 8 to Nov. 11, and concluded with 214 MS-13 arrests nationwide.\nHSI received significant operational support, including intelligence sharing and collaboration, from ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the U.S. Department of Treasury, U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Prisons (BOP), as well as state, local, federal, and international law enforcement partners.\u00a0 The Organized Crime and Gang Section of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, with funding from the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, along with the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices in the Districts of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Northern District of California, Southern District of Iowa and Southern District of Texas, and are prosecuting the cases.\u00a0\n\"Securing the homeland is a critical piece of the USCIS mission,\u201d said USCIS Director L.

Eighteen other defendants were also sentenced in Houston before Judge Hittner this week: In addition to these 21 defendants, three others were previously sentenced for their involvement in the same fraud and money laundering scheme: According to various admissions made in connection with the defendants\u2019 guilty pleas, between 2012 and 2016, the defendants and their conspirators perpetrated a complex fraud and money laundering scheme in which individuals from call centers located in Ahmedabad, India, frequently impersonated officials from the IRS or USCIS in a ruse designed to defraud victims located throughout the United States.\u00a0 Using information obtained from data brokers and other sources, call center operators targeted U.S. victims who were threatened with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay alleged monies owed to the government.\u00a0 Victims who agreed to pay the scammers were instructed how to provide payment, including by purchasing stored value cards or wiring money.\u00a0 Once a victim provided payment, the call centers turned to a network of runners based in the United States to liquidate and launder the extorted funds as quickly as possible by purchasing reloadable cards or retrieving wire transfers. \u00a0In a typical scenario, call centers directed runners to purchase these stored value reloadable cards and transmit the unique card number to India-based co-conspirators who registered the cards using the misappropriated personal identifying information (PII) of U.S. citizens.\u00a0 The India-based co-conspirators then loaded these cards with scam funds obtained from victims.\u00a0 The runners used the stored value cards to purchase money orders that they deposited into the bank account of another person.\u00a0 For their services, the runners would earn a specific fee or a percentage of the funds.\u00a0 Runners also received victims\u2019 funds via wire transfers, which were retrieved under fake names and through the use of using false identification documents, direct bank deposits by victims, and Apple iTunes or other gift cards that victims purchased.\u00a0 The indictment in this case also charged 32 India-based conspirators and five India-based call centers with general conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy.\u00a0 These defendants have yet to be arraigned in this case.\u00a0 An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

WASHINGTON \u2013 The Justice Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and 49 state attorneys general announced today the filing of their landmark $25 billion agreement with the nation\u2019s five largest mortgage servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses.\u00a0 The federal government and state attorneys general filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia proposed consent judgments with Bank of America Corporation, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Company, Citigroup Inc. and Ally Financial Inc., to resolve violations of state and federal law.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The unprecedented joint agreement is the largest federal-state civil settlement ever obtained and is the result of extensive investigations by federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, HUD and the HUD Office of the Inspector General (HUD-OIG), and state attorneys general and state banking regulators across the country.\u00a0 The consent judgments provide the details of the servicers\u2019 financial obligations under the agreement, which include payments to foreclosed borrowers and more than $20 billion in consumer relief; new standards the servicers will be required to implement regarding mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure practices; and the oversight and enforcement authorities of the independent settlement monitor, Joseph A. Smith Jr.\u00a0 The consent judgments require the servicers to collectively dedicate $20 billion toward various forms of financial relief to homeowners, including: reducing the principal on loans for borrowers who are delinquent or at imminent risk of default and owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth; refinancing loans for borrowers who are current on their mortgages but who owe more on their mortgage than their homes are worth; forbearance of principal for unemployed borrowers; anti-blight provisions; short sales; transitional assistance; and benefits for service members. The consent judgments\u2019 consumer relief requirements include varying amounts of partial credit the servicers will receive for every dollar spent on the required relief activities.\u00a0 Because servicers will receive only partial credit for many of the relief activities, the agreement will result in benefits to borrowers in excess of $20 billion.\u00a0 The servicers are required to complete 75 percent of their consumer relief obligations within two years and 100 percent within three years.\u00a0 In addition to the $20 billion in financial relief for borrowers, the consent judgments require the servicers to pay $5 billion in cash to the federal and state governments.\u00a0 Approximately $1.5 billion of this payment will be used to establish a Borrower Payment Fund to provide cash payments to borrowers whose homes were sold or taken in foreclosure between Jan. 1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2011, and who meet other criteria.\u00a0 The court documents filed today also provide detailed new servicing standards that the mortgage servicers will be required to implement.\u00a0 These standards will prevent foreclosure abuses of the past, such as robo-signing, improper documentation and lost paperwork, and create new consumer protections.\u00a0 The new standards provide for strict oversight of foreclosure processing, including third-party vendors, and new requirements to undertake pre-filing reviews of certain documents filed in bankruptcy court.\u00a0 The new servicing standards make foreclosure a last resort by requiring servicers to evaluate homeowners for other loss mitigation options first.\u00a0 Servicers will be restricted from foreclosing while the homeowner is being considered for a loan modification.\u00a0 The new standards also include procedures and timelines for reviewing loan modification applications and give homeowners the right to appeal denials.\u00a0 Servicers will also be required to create a single point of contact for borrowers seeking information about their loans and maintain adequate staff to handle calls. The consent judgments provide enhanced protections for service members that go beyond those required by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).\u00a0 In addition, the servicers have agreed to conduct a full review, overseen by the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, to determine whether any service members were foreclosed or improperly charged interest in excess of 6 percent on their mortgage in violation of SCRA. The oversight and enforcement authorities of the settlement\u2019s independent monitor are detailed in the court documents filed today.\u00a0 The monitor will oversee implementation of the servicing standards and consumer relief activities required by the agreement and publish regular public reports that identify any quarter in which a servicer fell short of the standards imposed in the settlement.\u00a0 The consent judgments require servicers to remediate any harm to borrowers that are identified in quarterly reviews overseen by the monitor and, in some instances, conduct full look-backs to identify any additional borrowers who may have been harmed.\u00a0 If a servicer violates the requirements of the consent judgment it will be subject to penalties of up to $1 million per violation or up to $5 million for certain repeat violations. The consent judgments filed today resolve certain violations of civil law based on mortgage loan servicing activities.\u00a0 The agreement does not prevent state and federal authorities from pursuing criminal enforcement actions related to this or other conduct by the servicers.\u00a0 The agreement does not prevent the government from punishing wrongful securitization conduct that will be the focus of the new Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group.\u00a0 In the servicing agreement, the United States also retains its full authority to recover losses and penalties caused to the federal government when a bank failed to satisfy underwriting standards on a government-insured or government-guaranteed loan; the United States also resolved certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) origination claims with Bank of America as part of this filing and with Citibank in a separate matter.\u00a0 The agreement does not prevent any action by individual borrowers who wish to bring their own lawsuits.\u00a0 State attorneys general also preserved, among other things, all claims against the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS), and all claims brought by borrowers.\u00a0 Investigations were conducted by the U.S. Trustee Program of the Department of Justice, HUD-OIG, HUD\u2019s FHA, state attorneys general offices and state banking regulators from throughout the country, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Colorado, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of North Carolina, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of South Carolina, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Federal Housing Finance Agency-Office of the Inspector General.\u00a0 The Department of the Treasury, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture made critical contributions.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to focus on those violent criminals who illegally use firearms to prey on their victims,\u201d said ATF Special Agent in Charge King.\u00a0 \u201cThrough a collective effort with our law enforcement partners this operation was a success today.\u201d     \u00a0        \u201cThis multi-year investigation and indictment clearly targets the worst-of-the-worst among the ABT,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Morris.\u00a0 \u201cThis effort not only exemplifies the level of effort the FBI and our law enforcement partners will expend to prevent prison gang racism and criminal activity from poisoning our communities.\u00a0 It sends a clear message that we will relentlessly pursue and prosecute the leaders and members of these criminal enterprises regardless of where they lay their heads.\u201d     \u00a0     As charged, the defendants range from senior leaders to soldiers of the ABT, a \u201cwhites only,\u201d prison-based gang with members operating inside and outside of state and federal prisons throughout Texas and elsewhere in the United States since at least the early 1980s.\u00a0      \u00a0     According to court documents, the ABT has a detailed and uniform organizational structure, with territory divided into five regions, each run by a \u201cgeneral.\u201d\u00a0 The superseding indictment charges four generals, Terry Ross Blake, 55, aka \u201cBig Terry\u201d; Larry Max Bryan, 51, aka \u201cSlick\u201d; William David Maynard, 42, aka \u201cBaby Huey\u201d; and Charles Lee Roberts, 68, aka \u201cJive,\u201d with conspiracy to participate in the racketeering activities of the ABT, among other charges.     \u00a0     In total, the superseding indictment charges 34 alleged members of the ABT with conspiracy to participate in the racketeering activities of the ABT.\u00a0 Alleged members of the ABT are also charged with involvement in three murders, multiple attempted murders, kidnappings, assaults and conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine.     \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      According to the superseding indictment, the ABT was established in the early 1980s within the Texas prison system.\u00a0 The gang modeled itself after and adopted many of the precepts and writings of the Aryan Brotherhood, a California-based prison gang that was formed in the California prison system during the 1960s.\u00a0 According to court documents, previously, the ABT was primarily concerned with the protection of white inmates and white supremacy/separatism.\u00a0 Over time, the ABT is alleged to have has expanded its criminal enterprise to include illegal activities for profit.     \u00a0     Court documents allege that the ABT enforced its rules and promoted discipline among its members, prospects and associates through murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, arson, assault, robbery and threats against those who violate the rules or pose a threat to the enterprise.\u00a0 Members, and oftentimes associates, were required to follow the orders of higher-ranking members, often referred to as \u201cdirect orders.\u201d     \u00a0       According to the superseding indictment, in order to be considered for membership, a person must be sponsored by another ABT member.\u00a0 Once sponsored, a prospective member must serve an     unspecified term, during which he is referred to as a prospect, while his conduct is observed by the members of the ABT.         Ten defendants have been charged with offenses that are eligible for the death penalty. \u00a0The remaining 24 defendants face a maximum penalty of life in prison.    An indictment is not evidence of guilt.\u00a0 All defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.      \u00a0     This case is being investigated by a multi-agency task force consisting of the ATF; Drug Enforcement Administration; FBI; U.S. Marshals Service; Federal Bureau of Prisons;     U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations; Texas Rangers; Texas Department of Public Safety; the Montgomery County, Texas, Sheriff\u2019s Department; Houston Police Department-Gang Division; Texas Department of Criminal Justice  \u2013 Office of  Inspector General; Harris County, Texas, Sheriff\u2019s Office; Tarrant County,     Texas, Sheriff\u2019s Office; Atascosa County, Texas, Sheriff\u2019s Office; Orange County, Texas, Sheriff\u2019s Office; Waller County, Texas, Sheriff\u2019s Office; Fort Worth, Texas, Police Department; San Antonio Police Department; Baytown, Texas, Police Department; Carrollton, Texas, Police Department; Alvin, Texas, Police Department; Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s Office; Atascosa County District Attorney\u2019s Office; Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office; and the Kaufman County, Texas, District Attorney\u2019s Office.

{"id": null, "title": "34 Individuals Facing Federal and Tribal Charges Relating to Methamphetamine Trafficking on the Mescalero Apache Reservation", "contents": "Thirty-four individuals are facing federal and tribal drug charges as the result of an 18-month multi-agency investigation spearheaded by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) into methamphetamine trafficking on the Mescalero Apache Reservation.\u00a0 Eighteen defendants, including five members of the Mescalero Apache Tribe and 13 non-Natives are charged in six indictments and a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico in November and December 2015.\u00a0 Sixteen other members of the Mescalero Apache Tribe are charged in tribal criminal complaints approved by the Mescalero Apache Tribal Court. The investigation leading to the federal and tribal charges was initiated in May 2014 in response to an increase in violent crime on the Mescalero Apache Reservation perpetrated by methamphetamine users.\u00a0 The investigation initially targeted a drug trafficking organization allegedly led by Lorenzo Saenz, a member of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, which distributed methamphetamine within the Reservation.\u00a0 It later expanded to include two other drug trafficking organizations in southern New Mexico that allegedly served as sources of supply for the methamphetamine distributed within the reservation.\u00a0 In August 2014, the investigation was designated as part of the Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, which combines the resources and unique expertise of federal agencies, along with their local counterparts, in a coordinated effort to disrupt and dismantle major drug trafficking organizations.\u00a0 The investigation is one of the first OCDETF investigations to utilize electronic surveillance (wiretaps) in Indian Country.\u00a0 More than ten kilograms of methamphetamine were seized during the course of the investigation. \u201cMethamphetamine has a disproportionate devastating impact on tribal communities, accounting for up to 40 percent of violent crime on reservations,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Damon P. Martinez of the District of New Mexico.\u00a0 \u201cThis investigation is an example of the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to working with Tribal Governments to improve the safety of Native communities and increase awareness of the dangers of methamphetamine use.\u201d \u201cI want to thank the BIA\u2019s Division of Drug Enforcement and Office of Justice Services, the DEA and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the many, many hours they put forth during this investigation,\u201d said President Danny Breuninger of the Mescalero Apache Tribe.\u00a0 \u201cBefore and since taking Office as the President of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, I heard complaints from our Tribal Members and saw the pain and suffering caused by illegal\u00a0drug use and sales\u00a0on our Reservation.\u00a0 Many of our young people\u00a0are being poisoned by methamphetamine and lives are being shattered by senseless drug-related injuries and deaths.\u00a0 As the leader of my Tribe, it is my job to do all I can to preserve the safety and\u00a0welfare of our people and to preserve our culture, traditions and customs.\u00a0 The great majority of our Tribal Members are great people who work hard every day to support their families and raise their children\u00a0with the values and traditions that have been passed down generation after generation.\u00a0 But continuing to do this is very hard when our Tribal Members\u2019\u00a0lives are being torn apart by illegal drug use.\u00a0 I call on the federal government, including the President, the Attorney General and Congress, to continue supporting and working with BIA and tribal police departments in these types of collaborative efforts throughout Indian Country.\u00a0 Thank you again for all of the support and dedication in serving the Mescalero Apache Tribe.\u201d Saenz and four other members of the Mescalero Apache Tribe are charged in four federal indictments with distributing methamphetamine within the Mescalero Apache Reservation.\u00a0 Saenz and a co-defendant are alleged to have participated in a methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy during which they sold methamphetamine to undercover agents on multiple occasions.\u00a0 Saenz was one of two federal defendants arrested on Dec. 11, when 13 of the 16 tribal defendants were also arrested. \u00a0A third federal Mescalero Apache defendant is in state custody on unrelated charges and the remaining two have yet to be arrested.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thirteen non-Natives, alleged members of two drug trafficking organizations that supplied the methamphetamine distributed within the Mescalero Apache Reservation, are charged in two other federal indictments and a federal criminal complaint.\u00a0 Eight of the non-Natives are charged with methamphetamine trafficking and money laundering offenses in a 24-count indictment; three are charged with methamphetamine trafficking offenses in a five-count indictment; and two are charged with methamphetamine trafficking offenses in a criminal complaint.\u00a0 Eight of the non-Natives have been arrested, two are in state custody on unrelated charges and three have yet to be arrested. \u201cThe DEA and Bureau of Indian Affairs dismantled three drug trafficking organizations distributing methamphetamine on the Mescalero Apache Reservation and across southeastern New Mexico,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Will R. Glaspy of the DEA\u2019s El Paso Division. \u201cThis is our warning to others who think they can hide their crimes on Tribal Lands:\u00a0 we are coming for you.\u201d \u201cThe BIA would like to thank the DEA and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for an outstanding collaborative effort that shows the resolve of our law enforcement partners to address the issue of illicit drug use in Indian Country and their dedication to provide safe communities for Indian people,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge William McClure of District IV of BIA\u2019s Office of Justice Services.\u00a0 \u201cThe many hours and resources that went in to this operation have increased the safety of tribal community members and reduced their fear of the danger posed by these individuals charged and their associates.\u201d \u201cMethamphetamine continues to have a devastating effect on Native American families and communities throughout Indian Country,\u201d said Regional Agent in Charge Gary Cunningham of BIA\u2019s Division of Drug Enforcement.\u00a0 \u201cThe results of this multi-agency investigation are a great example of what can be accomplished when the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies combine efforts and resources to remove these drug trafficking organizations from our communities.\u00a0 Indian Country is grateful for these partnerships and BIA will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to aggressively remove these negative elements from our communities.\u201d The federal and tribal cases were investigated by the Las Cruces office of the DEA, District IV of the BIA\u2019s Office of Justice Services (Mescalero Agency), BIA\u2019s Division of Drug Enforcement, Mescalero Tribal Police Department, Hatch Police Department, FBI and Lea County Drug Task Force.\u00a0 The following additional agencies assisted the investigating agencies with law enforcement operations on Nov. 20 and Dec. 11:\u00a0 U.S. Marshals Service, Homeland Security Investigations, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Border Patrol, New Mexico State Police, HIDTA Interagency Metro Narcotics, New Mexico National Guard, Chaves County Metro Narcotics Task Force, Pecos Valley Drug Task Force, Alamogordo Police Department, Ruidoso Police Department, Socorro Police Department Sunland Park Police Department and Tularosa Police Department.

{"id": "11-299", "title": "35 Members and Associates of Barrio Azteca Gang Charged with Racketeering and Other Offenses, Including 10 Charged in U.S. Consulate Murders in Juarez, Mexico", "contents": "      WASHINGTON \u2013 Thirty-five members and associates of the Barrio Azteca (BA) gang have been charged in a third superseding indictment unsealed today with various counts of racketeering, murder, drug offenses, money laundering and obstruction of justice, announced Attorney General Eric Holder.  Of the 35 defendants, 10 Mexican nationals were charged with the March 13, 2010, murders in Juarez, Mexico, of U.S. Consulate employee Leslie Ann Enriquez Catton, her husband Arthur Redelfs and Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of a U.S. Consulate employee.       \u00a0       Attorney General Holder was joined in announcing the charges by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John E. Murphy for the Western District of Texas,     FBI Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry and Administrator Michele Leonhart of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).       \u00a0       Today, teams of U.S. federal, state and local authorities arrested in Texas and New Mexico 12 of the charged defendants not already in custody.  Seven of the 10 defendants charged with the March 13, 2010, murders, and two other indicted defendants, are in custody in Mexico.  U.S. authorities are working with Mexican authorities regarding extradition and other matters related to this ongoing prosecution.         \u00a0       \u201cThe indictment unsealed today represents our continued action to ensure safety along our Southwest border, to seek justice for victims of violent crime in this region, and to weaken dangerous criminal organizations currently operating in Mexico and the United States,\u201d said Attorney General Holder.  \u201cThese arrests and criminal charges will disrupt Barrio Azteca\u2019s current operations, and they reaffirm that we will not tolerate acts of violence against those who serve and protect American citizens.  We will continue to stand with our partners in Mexico, and together, build on our unprecedented joint efforts to combat violence and protect the safety of the American and the Mexican people.\u201d        \u00a0       \u201cThe indictment unsealed today offers a chilling picture of a highly organized, and extremely brutal gang,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.\u00a0 \u201cThe victims \u2013 like so many other victims of the Mexican drug wars \u2013 were senselessly caught in the crosshairs of a violent criminal enterprise. This is, at times, a gruesome battle. \u00a0But let there be no mistake: \u00a0we will devote our might to bringing Barrio Azteca and other gangs to justice for their acts of violence and intimidation along our border.\u201d     \u201cThe vicious murders of Leslie Enriquez, her husband Arthur Redelfs, and Jorge Salcido illustrate how senseless the violence perpetrated by the drug cartels and their affiliated criminal gangs has become,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Murphy.\u00a0 \u201cOur hearts go out to the families of these three innocent victims, as well as thousands of others, who have suffered tragic losses for which there can be no reparation. The indictment reflects our resolve to vigorously pursue those responsible for these wanton acts and hold them accountable under the rule of law.\u201d       \u201cTrans-border violence is a serious threat that we are using the power of partnerships to combat and prevent,\u201d said     FBI Executive Assistant Director Henry.  \u201cAlong with our other federal, state and local law enforcement counterparts, we are especially grateful to our Mexican partner agencies for the critical support they provided to help resolve this case and bring the subjects to justice.  We may stand on opposite sides of the border, but we stand together on the same side of the law.\u201d       \u00a0       \u201cBarrio Azteca gang members are cold blooded criminals who show no respect for the law or justice  , murdering innocent victims, trafficking drugs and inciting violence,\u201d said DEA Administrator Leonhart.  \u201cBut, along with our FBI partners and the support of the government of Mexico, we have shown that the rule of law will prevail, and working together we will bring these individuals to justice to answer for their ruthless criminal activities.\u201d       \u00a0       The indictment alleges that the defendants are members or associates of the BA, which began in the late 1980s as a violent prison gang and has expanded into a transnational criminal organization.  The BA is primarily based in West Texas; Juarez, Mexico; and throughout state and federal prisons in the United States and Mexico.  The gang has a militaristic command structure and includes captains, lieutenants, sergeants and soldiers \u2013 all with the purpose of maintaining power and enriching its members and associates through drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, intimidation, violence, threats of violence and murder.       \u00a0       The indictment alleges that to increase its power and influence, the BA formed an alliance with the Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes (VCF) drug trafficking organization in Mexico.  As part of this alliance, the BA allegedly conducts enforcement operations against VCF rivals and the VCF provides illegal drugs to the BA at discounted prices.         \u00a0       The indictment alleges a host of criminal activity committed by members and associates of the BA since Jan. 1, 2003, including drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, kidnapping and murder, including the March 13, 2010, consulate murders in Juarez.         \u00a0       Specifically, the indictment alleges that on March 13, 2010, Ricardo Valles de la Rosa called an individual in the Western District of Texas and received verification of the description of an intended target for murder.  The indictment alleges that 10 named BA members, among others, participated in the murders of Enriquez, Redelfs and Salcido in Juarez.       \u00a0       Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, aka \u201cDiego\u201d; Eduardo Ravelo, aka \u201cTablas\u201d; Luis Mendez, aka \u201cAlex\u201d; Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, aka \u201cBenny\u201d; Ricardo Valles de la Rosa, aka \u201cChino\u201d; Jose Guadalupe Diaz Diaz, aka \u201cZorro\u201d; Martin Perez Marrufo, aka \u201cPopeye\u201d; Luis Humberto Hernandez Celis, aka \u201cPac\u201d; Miguel Angel Nevarez, aka \u201cLentes\u201d; and Enrique Guajardo Lopez, aka \u201cKiki\u201d are charged in the indictment with conspiracy to kill persons in a foreign country, murder resulting from the use and carrying of a firearm and murder in aid of racketeering for their alleged participation in the murder of Enriquez, Redelfs and Salcido.        \u00a0       Hernandez, Ravelo and Mendez are currently at large.   The United States has filed provisional arrest warrants with the government of Mexico for the arrest of these men in connection with this case.  Ravelo is currently one of the FBI\u2019s Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, and the FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading directly to his arrest.       \u00a0       In addition to the consulate murders, the indictment alleges that in December 2006, a BA member shot and killed Jose Luis Oviedo in El Paso.  In 2007, BA members allegedly kidnapped a man in El Paso and took him across the U.S./Mexico border to Juarez.  In March 2008, the BA allegedly ordered the murder of BA member David Merez, who was killed that same month in Juarez.  The indictment also alleges that the BA caused two persons to be shot and killed in Socorro, Texas, on July 2, 2009.  In August 2010, the indictment alleges that BA members kidnapped the wife and parents of a BA member whom they believed was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement and also killed the BA member\u2019s step-daughter.        \u00a0       According to the indictment, the BA profits by importing heroin, cocaine and marijuana into the United States from Mexico. The indictment points to specific acts in which more than 8 kilos of heroin, more than 100 kilograms of cocaine, and nearly 300 pounds of marijuana are associated with the possession, distribution or importation of controlled substances into the United States.         \u00a0       BA members and associates also allegedly charge a \u201cstreet tax\u201d or \u201ccuota\u201d on businesses and criminals operating in their turf.  These profits are used to support BA members in prison by funneling money into prison commissary accounts of gang leaders and to pay for defense lawyers or fines.  The \u201ccuota\u201d profits are also allegedly reinvested into the organization to purchase drugs, guns and ammunition.       If convicted, the defendants face a variety of maximum penalties per charge, including up to life in prison.        \u00a0       An indictment is merely an accusation.  All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.        \u00a0       The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Joseph A. Cooley of the Criminal Division\u2019s Gang Unit, Trial Attorney Brian Skaret of the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Texas.

Working with our law enforcement partners we will continue to combine our efforts and resources to keep our communities safe and to protect our children from violent street gangs.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe assaults, the robberies, the drug deals, each and every crime committed by these ruthless gang members was a blow to the safety of our communities,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Strong. \u201cThe guilty pleas by these suspects are the next step in securing justice for every innocent person who was impacted by the violent actions of these gangs members.\u201d Omari Rosero, aka Uno B, 41, of Elmira, New York, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy.\u00a0 According to the factual basis of Rosero\u2019s plea agreement, the Nine Trey Gangsters\u2019 leadership proceeds in rank, from lowest to highest, from \u201cScrap,\u201d \u201c1-Star General\u201d through \u201c5-Star General,\u201d \u201cLow,\u201d \u201cHigh,\u201d and, \u201cGodfather.\u201d\u00a0 During his plea, Omari Rosero admitted to holding the leadership rank of \u201cHigh,\u201d and to serving as an acting \u201cGodfather\u201d of the entire UBN gang.\u00a0 According to a recorded jail call, Omari Rosero admitted to being, together with Pedro Gutierrez, aka Magoo, and James Baxton, aka Frank White, \u201cthe last ones that God put in power\u201d over the UBN.\u00a0 Rosero conducted gang business and participated in the distribution of gang dues while incarcerated in the New York State Department of Corrections. Porsha Talina Rosero, aka Lady Uno B, 35, of Syracuse, New York, pleaded guilty today to racketeering conspiracy.\u00a0 Rosero, who has a tattoo of \u201cMrs. Uno B\u201d on her chest, referring to Omari Rosero, maintained a Facebook account through which private messages were sent from Omari Rosero to other Bloods leaders.\u00a0 According to the factual basis of her plea agreement, Porsha Rosero further admitted to participating in the distribution of gang dues, and to participating in a phone call during which Omari Rosero stated that a suspected cooperator would be \u201cfaded straight up.\u201d In addition to Omari and Porsha Rosero, seven other defendants with high-ranking leadership positions have previously pleaded guilty in this investigation: Furthermore, the following defendants have also pleaded guilty in this case: According to admissions made in connection with the plea agreements, the UBN is a violent criminal street gang operating throughout the east coast of the United States since its inception as a prison gang in 1993.\u00a0 UBN members are often identified by their use of the color red, and can also often be identified by common tattoos or burn marks. \u00a0Examples include: a three-circle pattern, usually burned onto the upper arm, known as a \u201cdog paw\u201d; the acronym \u201cM.O.B.,\u201d which stands for \u201cMember of Bloods\u201d; the words \u201cdamu,\u201d or \u201ceastside\u201d; the number five; the five-pointed star; and the five-pointed crown. \u00a0UBN members have distinct hand signs and written codes, which are used to identify other members and rival gang members.\u00a0 The Nine Trey Gangster set of the UBN refer to themselves as \u201cBillies.\u201d Furthermore, the plea agreements note that the UBN is governed by a common set of 31 rules, known as \u201cThe 31,\u201d which were originally written by the founders of the UBN.\u00a0 Members of the UBN are expected to conduct themselves and their illegal activity according to rules and regulations set by their leaders.\u00a0 Prominent among these is a requirement to pay monthly dues to the organization, often in the amounts of $31 or $93.\u00a0 A percentage of these funds are transferred to incarcerated UBN leadership in New York; these funds also are used locally to conduct gang business.\u00a0 UBN gang dues are derived from illegal activity performed by subordinate UBN members including narcotics trafficking, robberies, wire fraud, and bank fraud, among other forms of illegal racketeering activities. The convictions are the result of a joint effort by the FBI; the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department; the Shelby Police Department; the Cleveland County Sheriff\u2019s Office; the Gastonia Police Department; the North Carolina State Highway Patrol; the Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office; the North Carolina Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice; the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles; the U.S. Federal Probation; the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command; and the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, Office of Special Investigations.\u00a0 The case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Gang Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of North Carolina. This prosecution is part of an extensive investigation by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF). \u00a0OCDETF is a joint federal, state, and local cooperative approach to combat drug trafficking and is the nation\u2019s primary tool for disrupting and dismantling major drug trafficking organizations, targeting national and regional level drug trafficking organizations, and coordinating the necessary law enforcement entities and resources to disrupt or dismantle the targeted criminal organization and seize their assets.", "date": "2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Criminal Division", "USAO - North Carolina, Western"]}
{"id": "17-1079", "title": "3,800 Gang Members Charged in Operation Spanning United States and Central America", "contents": "Senior law enforcement officials from the United States, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras announced here today criminal charges against more than 3,800 MS-13 and 18th Street gang members in the United States and Central America in a coordinated law enforcement action known as Operation Regional Shield. The charges were announced by Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the United States, Attorney General Douglas Mel\u00e9ndez of El Salvador, Attorney General Thelma Aldana of Guatemala, and Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla of Honduras, marking the six-month anniversary of the commitment to combat transnational organized crime initiated in March by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, together with the Attorneys General of the three Central American countries. The more than 3,800 individuals charged announced today include over 70 individuals in the United States in California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Virginia. Law enforcement officers seized six firearms and charged 284 gang members in Guatemala; seized 14 businesses and 11 luxury vehicles and arrested 12 MS-13 money launderers in Honduras; and filed 3,477 criminal charges, resulting in more than 1,400 arrests in El Salvador. Cases resulting from Operation Regional Shield include: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One indictment unsealed yesterday in the District of Massachusetts charges Edwin Manica Flores aka Sugar, Chugar and Shugar, an MS-13 leader incarcerated for murder in El Salvador, with a RICO conspiracy for alleged criminal activity he directed in the United States as the leader of MS-13\u2019s \u201cEast Coast Program.\u201d \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Charges filed in Long Island on July 19 against 17 MS-13 members for 12 murders, including the April 11 quadruple murder of four men in Central Islip; racketeering; attempted murders; assaults; obstruction of justice; arson; conspiracy to distribute marijuana; and firearms. On February 9, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking to dismantle and eradicate transnational gangs threatening the safety of our communities. Pursuant to that order, Attorney General Sessions has made dismantling transnational gangs, including MS-13, a top priority. In March, Attorney General Sessions met with his counterparts from the region and developed strategies and concrete plans to give a strong and coordinated response to MS-13\u2019s increasingly transnational criminal activities.\u00a0 Over the last six months, prosecution teams from the region have been sharing information, evidence and best practices to combat the gangs, as well as coordinating simultaneous operations against gangs that affect both the United States and Central America.\u00a0 \u201cMS-13 is one of the most violent and ruthless gangs in America today, endangering communities in more than 40 states. But under President Trump\u2019s strong leadership, the Department of Justice is taking them off our streets,\u201d\u00a0Attorney General Sessions said.\u00a0\u201cToday,\u00a0we are announcing that our partnership with law enforcement in Central America, has yielded charges against more than 3,800\u00a0gang members just in the last six months. More than 70 of these defendants were living in the United States, from California to Ohio to Boston. MS-13 coordinates across our borders to kill, rape, and traffic drugs and underage girls; we\u2019ve got to coordinate across our borders to stop them. That\u2019s exactly what our courageous and professional DOJ agents and attorneys are doing. We will continue to maintain this steadfast policy and dismantle this gang.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cStudying their modus operandi, we realized tackling [the gangs] would require working jointly with the United States, Guatemala, and El Salvador,\u201d said Honduran Attorney General Chinchilla Banegas.\u00a0 \u201cThis approach has allowed us to share information and strike the financial structures of the gangs.\u201d \u201cWe conducted simultaneous operations coordinated among all of our countries impacting the leadership structure of the gangs and with an emphasis on the gang cliques which are generating the most revenues and with the strongest transnational ties,\u201d said El Salvadoran Attorney General Melendez Ruiz.\u201d \u201cOur citizens demand prompt and effective responses from the security and justice system,\u201d said Guatemalan Attorney General Aldana Hernandez. \u201cWe must therefore continue promoting and implementing actions such as Operation Regional Shield that effectively strengthen the rule of law and build safer, more supportive, more prosperous and fairer societies.\u201d In El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the investigation into MS-13 is being handled by regional gang prosecutors who receive State Department-funded training and mentoring from the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development Assistance and Training (OPDAT). With support from State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, prosecutors from OPDAT helped establish task forces in the region and work with FBI\u2019s local Transnational Anti-Gang (TAG) units, as well as HSI\u2019s Transnational Criminal Investigative Units (TCIUs). These efforts have helped Central American partners convict thousands of criminals, seize over $1 billion in illicit assets, and coordinate on dozens of transnational investigations with their U.S. counterparts.", "date": "2017-09-29T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Criminal Division"]}

On Dec. 21, 2011, 3M and Avery agreed that 3M would acquire Avery\u2019s Office and Consumer Products Group, which includes Avery\u2019s labels business, for approximately $550 million.\u00a0 The agreement specifically excluded some sticky notes assets, but left Avery without its brand or the sales and distribution system necessary to compete effectively in the sticky notes market.\u00a0      \u201cWe welcome the companies\u2019 decision to abandon this deal, which raised competitive concerns in the sale of labels and sticky notes,\u201d said Joseph Wayland, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division.\u00a0 \u201cAs a result of the abandonment of this transaction, American customers will continue to receive the benefits of competition including lower prices and greater innovation in these basic office supplies.\u201d     The department\u2019s investigation found that 3M and Avery have dominated adjacent spaces in the office products business for many years \u2013 Avery in labels and 3M in sticky notes sold under its Post-it Brand.\u00a0 3M entered the labels market in the United States in 2009 and began competing with Avery.\u00a0 Avery responded to 3M\u2019s entry by lowering wholesale prices, increasing promotions and customer rebates and accelerating innovations in labels.\u00a0 Avery also responded to 3M\u2019s labels competition by selling Avery branded sticky notes.\u00a0 As a result of the competition between 3M and Avery for the sale of office products, customers have saved millions of dollars and benefited from innovative labels and sticky notes products, the department said.\u00a0      \u00a0     The proposed merger would have given 3M more than an 80 percent share of both the U.S. labels and sticky notes markets, according to the department.      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      3M is a Delaware corporation based in Saint Paul, Minn.\u00a0 3M had 2011 revenues of $27 billion, has operations in 65 countries, and is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers and suppliers of office products, including tape, sticky notes, labels, flags and other office products.\u00a0 In 2011, 3M\u2019s Office Supplies Division had world-wide sales of approximately $1.6 billion.     \u00a0     Avery Dennison is a Delaware corporation based in Pasadena, Calif.\u00a0 Avery had 2011 revenues of $6 billion and is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of office and consumer products, including labels, dividers, binders, note tabs, writing instruments and sticky notes.\u00a0 In 2011, Avery\u2019s Office and Consumer Products Group had $765 million in world-wide sales.

Programs like Project Safe Neighborhood \u2013 a program among U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the country \u2013 also work to reduce violent crime by combining community-based policing, strategic prosecution and anti-crime initiatives with the resources of social service providers, educational systems and charitable foundations.        The department is also working to reduce childhood exposure to violence and raise awareness of its ramifications, while also advancing understandings of its causes and characteristics and countering its negative impact.       In addition, the Sentencing and Corrections Working Group is reviewing federal sentencing practices and determine how to better prepare federal prisoners to transition back into their communities.   Attorney General Eric Holder also recently convened the inaugural meeting of the Cabinet-level \u201cReentry Council\u201d in Washington to identify and to advance effective public safety and prisoner reentry strategies.   In addition, the Criminal Division has announced efforts to merge its Gang Unit and Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, bringing together an elite group of prosecutors with extensive knowledge and experience in combating criminal groups.   \u00a0   The charged defendants will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys from each of the respective districts in which the cases were brought.   The cases charged in Washington; Greenbelt, Md.; Nashville, Pittsburgh and San Francisco are also being prosecuted by trial attorneys from the Criminal Division\u2019s Gang Unit.   \u00a0   The cases were variously investigated by the numerous field offices of the FBI, ATF, and ICE Homeland Security Investigations, as well as numerous additional federal, state and local partners.   \u00a0   A copy of the department\u2019s survey on children\u2019s exposure to violence can be found at: www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/2009/ojjdp09162.htm", "date": "2011-02-09T00:00:00-05:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Criminal Division"]}
{"id": "12-043", "title": "50 Individuals Charged in Puerto Rico with Allegedly Trafficking Identities of Puerto Rican Us Citizens", "contents": "  WASHINGTON \u2013 Fifty individuals were charged in an indictment unsealed today in Puerto Rico with conspiracy to commit identification fraud in connection with their alleged roles in a scheme to traffic the identities of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens and corresponding identity documents.\u00a0   The charges were announced today by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Rosa E. Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e9lez for the District of Puerto Rico; Director John Morton of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); Chief Postal Inspector Guy Cottrell of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); Scott P. Bultrowicz, Director of the U.S. State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service; and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Acting Chief Rick Raven.   The one-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury on Dec. 29, 2011, and unsealed today. Defendants were arrested today in multiple districts throughout the United States and Puerto Rico and will make initial appearances in federal court in the districts in which they were arrested. In addition, law enforcement agents executed searches as part of an ongoing investigation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cThe indictment unsealed today alleges that from April 2009 to December 2011, the defendants operated an extensive black market, identity fraud ring,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. \u201cThe alleged conspiracy stretched across the United States and Puerto Rico, using suppliers, identity brokers and mail and money runners to fill and deliver orders for the personal identifying information and government-issued identity documents of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens. Those willing to buy and sell personal identifying information and documents should take notice of today\u2019s actions. The department and our law enforcement partners will not allow this kind of illegal activity to continue.\u201d   \u201cToday\u2019s arrests are a reflection of ICE Homeland Security Investigations unrelenting determination to identify and dismantle national smuggling rings engaged in document and identity fraud,\u201d said ICE Director John Morton. \u201cThe conspiracy alleged to be perpetrated by those charged undermines the integrity of our national immigration system. We will continue working with our federal partners to protect our homeland from criminals who have no regard for our nation\u2019s safety and security.\u201d   According to the indictment, from at least April 2009 to December 2011, conspirators in 15 states and Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, trafficked the identities of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens, corresponding Social Security cards, Puerto Rico birth certificates and other identification documents to undocumented aliens and others residing in the United States.   The indictment alleges that conspirators located in the Savarona area of Caguas, Puerto Rico, (Savarona suppliers) obtained the Puerto Rican identities and corresponding identity documents. Conspirators in various locations throughout the United States (identity brokers) solicited customers. The identity brokers allegedly sold Social Security cards and corresponding Puerto Rico birth certificates for prices ranging from $700 to $2,500 per set. The indictment alleges that identity brokers ordered the identity documents from Savarona suppliers, on behalf of the customers, by making coded telephone calls, including using terms such as \u201cshirts,\u201d \u201cuniforms\u201d or \u201cclothes,\u201d to refer to identity documents. Specifically, the brokers asked for \u201cskirts\u201d for female customers and \u201cpants\u201d for male customers in various \u201csizes,\u201d which referred to the ages of the identities sought by the customers.   According to the indictment, the Savarona suppliers generally requested that customers\u2019 initial payments be sent by the identity brokers through a money transfer service to persons whose names were provided by the Savarona suppliers. Savarona suppliers allegedly retrieved the payments from the money transfer service and then sent the identity documents to the brokers using express, priority or regular U.S. mail. The indictment alleges that various conspirators sent or received money and mail parcels. The conspirators frequently confirmed sender names and addresses, money transfer control numbers and trafficked identities via text messaging.   According to the indictment, once the identity brokers received the identity documents, they delivered the documents to the customers and obtained second payments. The brokers generally kept the second payments for themselves as profit. Some identity brokers allegedly assumed a Puerto Rican identity themselves and used that identity in connection with the trafficking operation.\u00a0   As alleged in the indictment, the customers generally obtained the identity documents to assume the identity of Puerto Rican U.S. citizens and to obtain additional identification documents, such as legitimate state driver\u2019s licenses. Some customers allegedly obtained the documents to commit financial fraud and attempted to obtain a U.S. passport.   \u201cFrom Main Street to Wall Street, identity fraud exacts a devastating toll on American consumers and businesses. U.S. Postal Inspectors will continue to aggressively investigate criminals who use the mail to defraud postal customers,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Cottrell.   \u201cThe Diplomatic Security Service is firmly committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who commit document trafficking and identity fraud,\u201d said Director Bultrowicz of the U.S. State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service. \u201cFraudulently-obtained documents are frequently used to apply for U.S. passports and visas, two of the most coveted travel documents in the world.\u201d   \u201cIRS Criminal Investigation has made investigating identity theft a top priority,\u201d said Acting Chief Raven of the IRS-CI. \u201cWe are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to unravel the money trail of criminal enterprises that defraud government and prey on unwitting victims.\u201d   The indictment alleges that various identity brokers were operating in Rockford, Ill.; Indianapolis; DeKalb, Ill.; Columbus and Seymour, Ind.; Aurora, Ill.; Hartford, Conn.; Clewiston, Fla.; Lilburn and Norcross, Ga.; Salisbury, Md.; Columbus, Ohio; Fairfield, Ohio; Dorchester, Mass.; Lawrence, Mass.; Salem, Mass.; Worcester, Mass.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Nebraska City, Neb.; Elizabeth, N.J.; Burlington, N.C.; Hickory, N.C.; Hazelton, Pa.; Philadelphia; Houston; and Abingdon, Va.   If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, as well as forfeiture.   The charges announced today are the result of Operation Island Express, an ongoing, nationally-coordinated investigation led by the ICE-HSI Chicago Office and USPIS, DSS and IRS-CI offices in Chicago, in coordination with the ICE-HSI San Juan Office. The Illinois Secretary of State Police; Elgin, Ill., Police Department; Seymour, Ind., Police Department; and Indiana State Police provided substantial assistance. The ICE-HSI Assistant Attach\u00e9 office in the Dominican Republic, National Drug Intelligence Center - Document and Media Exploitation Branch and International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2) provided invaluable assistance as well as various ICE, USPIS, DSS and IRS CI offices around the country.   The case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Division\u2019s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, with the assistance of the Criminal Division\u2019s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, and the support of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Puerto Rico.\u00a0 The U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices in the Northern District of Illinois, Southern District of Indiana and District of Connecticut provided substantial assistance. The U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices in the Middle District of Florida, Southern District of Florida, Northern District of Georgia, Western District of Kentucky, District of Maryland, District of Massachusetts, Western District of Michigan, District of Nebraska, District of New Jersey, Western District of North Carolina, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Southern District of Texas, Eastern District of Virginia, Southern District of Illinois, Western District of Texas, Middle District of Louisiana and Western District of Virginia also provided invaluable support.

According to the indictment, the defendants are charged with being part of La Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1ETA, a prison gang that operates in the prisons of the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (PRDCR).\u00a0 La Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1ETA is a criminal organization that engages in drug trafficking and murder. \u00a0The main purpose of the organization is to make money. \u00a0Inmates originally formed La Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1ETA as a means to advocate for their rights within the PRDCR. \u00a0The enterprise, however, evolved into a criminal organization that engaged in drug trafficking and murder within the prisons of the PRDCR. \u00a0The enterprise makes money by introducing multi-kilogram quantities of drugs into the PRDCR prisons for profit and by engaging in murders for hire. The indictment alleges that members and associates of La Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1ETA introduced and distributed multi-kilograms of cocaine, marijuana and heroin into the prisons of the PRDCR. \u00a0They were able to introduce this contraband into the prisons with the help of corrupt PRDCR Correctional Officers, civilians who worked inside of the prison system, people who visited inmates and persons who - from outside the prisons - threw drugs into the facilities ,known as pitcheos, which were caught by members of the enterprise. \u00a0Members of the enterprise and their associates also introduced cellular telephones into the prisons and charged a fee to other inmates for using the same. \u00a0Members of the enterprise would use cellular phones to engage in drug trafficking and murder. Specifically, the indictment alleges that people who were not incarcerated would hire La Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1ETA to kill persons who were serving time in the prisons of the PRDCR. La Asociaci\u00f3n \u00d1ETA participated in the murders for pecuniary gain. \u00a0Murders perpetrated by the organization include those of Mario Monta\u00f1ez-G\u00f3mez aka Emme on Aug. 27, 2014, and Alexis Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez aka Alexis El Loco on Nov. 6, 2014.

Glavin and Acting U.S. Attorney Nora R. Dannehy of the District of Connecticut.   Bryan Thomas Black, 30, of Waterloo, Ill., pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit criminal infringement of a copyright for his involvement in a multinational software piracy organization that was targeted by investigators as part of \"Operation Fastlink,\" an internationally coordinated 18-month investigation. Black will be sentenced by the Honorable Ellen Bree Burns on May 26, 2009, at which time he faces up to five years of in prison, a fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.   In pleading guilty today, Black admitted that, for nearly four years, he was a participant in the \"warez scene,\" an underground online community made up of individuals and organized groups who engage in the large scale reproduction, modification and distribution of copyrighted software through the Internet.\u00a0 In the warez scene, Black served as the person who would obtain new video game releases and circumvent the digital copyright protections so that the software could then be reproduced and distributed on the Internet. Black also admitted that during the course of the conspiracy, he downloaded thousands of pirated copies of copyrighted works from various Web sites, known as warez sites, knowing that his and his co-conspirators\u2019 actions were unlawful.

Cates, a matter involving the sexual assault of a victim by an individual using his enforcement authority as a Milwaukee police officer.\u00a0 Seizing on the defendant\u2019s inconsistent statements, the team of attorneys established that the victim had been truthful about the event.\u00a0 After a hotly contested trial, the jury convicted the defendant for raping the victim, and sentenced him to serve 24 years in prison.\u00a0 From the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, recipients include: Saeed Mody, Trial Attorney.\u00a0 From the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, recipients include: Mel S.

The John Marshall Award for the Handling of Appeals is presented to Alexander P. Robbins, a Trial Attorney in the Criminal Appeals and Tax Enforcement Policy Section of the Tax Division.\u00a0 Robbins is awarded for his extraordinary service to the department for representing the government on tax matters before the Supreme Court and other appellate and district courts.\u00a0 He has handled the most difficult tax matters for the department, including successfully advancing the application of the required records doctrine to grand jury subpoenas issued in international tax cases.

The John Marshall Award for Asset Forfeiture is presented to Daniel H. Claman, Assistant Deputy Chief for the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section of the Criminal Division.\u00a0 Claman is nominated for his exemplary work in implementing the Department\u2019s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and using civil forfeiture actions to recover the proceeds of foreign official corruption.\u00a0 He is a leader in the forfeiture of foreign corruption, and in the return of those ill-gotten gains to the victims of these crimes.

Marsh, Chief Trial Attorney for the Division of Enforcement at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for his work in addressing schemes to manipulate LIBOR interest rates.\u00a0 Marsh is nominated for his exceptional assistance to the department in the high-profile investigations and prosecutions of individuals, multi-national banks and other financial institutions engaged in wide-ranging and complex schemes to manipulate LIBOR and other benchmark interest rates affecting trillions of dollars of loans, mortgages and complex financial products worldwide.\u00a0 He has been one of the lead prosecutors on this matter from the inception of the investigations, and was responsible for investigating more than 20 banks and hundreds of individuals involved in the scheme.

Grindler, FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division Kevin Perkins and     Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson.     In this    national, multi-agency investigation, 52 were arrested today by FBI agents in the largest Medicare fraud scheme ever perpetrated by a single criminal enterprise and charged by the Department of Justice.        \u00a0       The defendants are charged with engaging in numerous fraud activities, including highly-organized, multi-million dollar schemes to defraud Medicare and  insurance companies by submitting fraudulent bills for medically unnecessary treatments or treatments that were never performed.  According to the indictments, the defendants allegedly stole the identities of doctors and thousands of Medicare beneficiaries and operated at least 118 different phony clinics in 25 states for the purposes of submitting Medicare reimbursements.      \u00a0       \u201cThe emergence of international organized crime in domestic health care fraud schemes signals a dangerous expansion that poses a serious threat to consumers as these syndicates are willing to exploit almost any program, business or individual to earn an illegal profit,\u201d said Acting Deputy Attorney General Gary G. Grinder. \u201cThe Department of Justice is confronting this evolving threat here and abroad through a number of initiatives including a strengthened Attorney General\u2019s Organized Crime Council and the creation of the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center (IOC-2) to ensure that we are focused and coordinated in our efforts to combat international organized crime.\u201d     \u00a0       \u201cThe international organized crime enterprise known as the Mirzoyan-Terdjanian, fleeced the health care system through a wide-range of money making criminal fraud schemes.\u00a0 The members and associates located throughout the United States and in Armenia, perpetrated a large-scale, nationwide Medicare scam that fraudulently billed Medicare for more than $100 million of unnecessary medical treatments using a series of phantom clinics,\u201d said Kevin Perkins, FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to restore the confidence in the nation\u2019s health care system and assure practitioners we will not stand by and let their identities be used for criminal gain.\u201d \u00a0     \u00a0       \u201cToday, special agents of the Office of Inspector General working in tight coordination with our federal law enforcement partners made 52 arrests across the nation\u2014from New York to Los Angeles\u2014on charges including Medicare fraud and medical identity theft totaling more than $163 million,\u201d said Daniel R.

This is the first time\u00a0a Vor has ever been charged for a racketeering offense, and the first time since 1996 that a known Vor has been arrested on any federal charge.     \u00a0       The racketeering charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine.

The conspiracy to commit immigration fraud charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.      \u00a0       The charges announced today are merely allegations, and defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.     \u00a0       The defendants charged in each district will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys from each of the respective districts in which the cases were charged.  The cases were investigated by special agents from the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles and New York field offices.     \u00a0    Today\u2019s arrests are an example of the FBI\u2019s ability to conduct cross-program, multi-divisional investigations targeting a national level threat. In recent years, the department has undertaken a series of steps to modernize its organized crime program and enable federal law enforcement to take a unified approach to combating international organized crime.  The Attorney General\u2019s Organized Crime Council brings together the leadership of the FBI and eight other federal law enforcement agencies or offices with the department\u2019s prosecutors, focusing high-level attention on these issues.     The IOC-2 provides support in the form of information and intelligence to the member agencies that enhance efforts to identify, penetrate and dismantle the most dangerous organized crime groups through investigations and prosecutions. The creation of the International Organized Crime Targeting Committee and the Top International Criminal Organizations Target (TICOT) List, directs investigators and prosecutors to concentrate their limited resources on those international organized crime groups that pose the greatest threat to the United States. The department\u2019s Criminal Division, through the Health Care Fraud Unit, Organized Crime and Racketeering Section and the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, has created new training programs to educate investigators and prosecutors on the intricacies of international organized crime and financial investigations.", "date": "2010-10-13T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Office of the Deputy Attorney General"]}
{"id": "18 - 759", "title": "74 Arrested in Coordinated International Enforcement Operation Targeting Hundreds of Individuals in Business Email Compromise Schemes ", "contents": "Federal authorities announced today a significant coordinated effort to disrupt Business Email Compromise (BEC) schemes that are designed to intercept and hijack wire transfers from businesses and individuals, including many senior citizens.\u00a0 Operation Wire Wire, a coordinated law enforcement effort by the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, was conducted over a six month period, culminating in over two weeks of intensified law enforcement activity resulting in 74 arrests in the United States and overseas, including 29 in Nigeria, and three in Canada, Mauritius and Poland.\u00a0 The operation also resulted in the seizure of nearly $2.4 million, and the disruption and recovery of approximately $14 million in fraudulent wire transfers.\nBEC, also known as \u201ccyber-enabled financial fraud,\u201d is a sophisticated scam often targeting employees with access to company finances and businesses working with foreign suppliers and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments.\u00a0 The same criminal organizations that perpetrate BEC also exploit individual victims, often real estate purchasers, the elderly, and others, by convincing them to make wire transfers to bank accounts controlled by the criminals. This is often accomplished by impersonating a key employee or business partner after obtaining access to that person\u2019s email account or sometimes done through romance and lottery scams.\u00a0 BEC scams may involve fraudulent requests for checks rather than wire transfers; they may target sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or employee tax records instead of, or in addition to, money; and they may not involve an actual \u201ccompromise\u201d of an email account or computer network.\u00a0 Foreign citizens perpetrate many BEC scams.\u00a0 Those individuals are often members of transnational criminal organizations, which originated in Nigeria but have spread throughout the world.\u00a0\n\u201cFraudsters can rob people of their life's savings in a matter of minutes,\u201d said Attorney General Sessions. \u201cThese are malicious and morally repugnant crimes. The Department of Justice has taken aggressive action against fraudsters in recent months, conducting the largest sweep of fraud against American seniors in history back in February. Now, in this operation alone, we have arrested 42 people in the United States and 29 others have been arrested in Nigeria for alleged financial fraud. And so I want to thank the FBI, nearly a dozen U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the Secret Service, Postal Inspection Services, Homeland Security Investigations, the Treasury Department, our partners in Nigeria, Poland, Canada, Mauritius, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and our state and local law enforcement partners for all of their hard work. We will continue to go on offense against fraudsters so that the American people can have safety and peace of mind.\u201d\n\u201cThis operation demonstrates the FBI\u2019s commitment to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises that target American citizens and their businesses,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. \u201cWe will continue to work together with our law enforcement partners around the world to end these fraud schemes and protect the hard-earned assets of our citizens. The public we serve deserves nothing less.\u201d\n\u201cThe Secret Service remains committed to aggressively investigating and pursuing those responsible for cyber-enabled financial crimes,\u201d said U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph \u201cTex\u201d Alles.\u00a0 \u201cAlthough the explosive expansion of the cyber domain has forced us to develop innovative ways of conducting these types of investigations, our proven model remains the same.\u201d\n\u201cFinCEN has been a leader in the fight against BEC and other cyber-enabled crime,\u201d said FinCEN Director Kenneth A. Blanco. \u201cSince 2014, working with our domestic and international partners, our Rapid Response Program has helped recover over $350 million stolen from innocent Americans.\u00a0 We must continue to be smarter, quicker, and better than the criminals that we face every day.\u00a0 Today\u2019s action is a victory, but it will take vigilance, time, and resources to take this fight into the future.\u00a0 In defense of the victims of these crimes, we are ready for the challenge.\u201d\n\u201cThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases,\u201d said Chief Postal Inspector Guy Cottrell. \u201cWe are proud to work alongside our fellow law enforcement partners in major efforts, such as Operation Wire Wire, to target those individuals who take advantage of the American public for illegal profits. Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable, regardless of where they are. Postal Inspectors will continue to work tirelessly to protect our customers from fraud.\u201d\u00a0\nA number of cases involved international criminal organizations that defrauded small to large sized businesses, while others involved individual victims who transferred high dollar funds or sensitive records in the course of business.\u00a0 The devastating effects these cases have on victims and victim companies, affect not only the individual business but also the global economy.\u00a0 Since the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) began keeping track of BEC and its variant, Email Account Compromise (EAC), as a complaint category, there has been a loss of over $3.7 billion reported to the IC3.\u00a0 BEC and EAC is a prevalent scam and the Justice Department along with our partners will continue to aggressively pursue and prosecute the perpetrators, including money mules, regardless of where they are located.\u00a0\nMoney mules may be witting or unwitting accomplices who receive ill-gotten funds from the victims and then transfer the funds as directed by the fraudsters.\u00a0 The money is wired or sent by check to the money mule who then deposits it in his or her own bank account.\u00a0 Usually the mules keep a fraction for \u201ctheir trouble\u201d and then wire the money as directed by the fraudster.\u00a0 The fraudsters enlist and manipulate the money mules through romance scams or \u201cwork-at-home\u201d scams.\nStarting in January 2018, this coordinated enforcement action targeted hundreds of BEC scammers.\u00a0 In addition, law enforcement agents executed over 51 domestic actions including search warrants, money mule warning letters, and asset seizure warrants totaling nearly $1 million.\u00a0 Local and state law enforcement partners on FBI task forces across the country, with the assistance of multiple District Attorney\u2019s Offices, charged 15 alleged money mules for their role in defrauding victims.\u00a0 These money mules were employed by the fraudsters to launder their ill-gotten gains by draining the funds into other accounts that are difficult to trace.\nAmong those arrested on federal charges in BEC schemes include: \nThe BEC scam is related to other forms of fraud such as: \nThe cases were investigated by the FBI, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and IRS Criminal Investigation.\u00a0 U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices in the Districts of Central California, Connecticut, Eastern Virginia, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Southern Florida, Southern Georgia, Southern Texas, Eastern Pennsylvania, Eastern Washington, Western Pennsylvania, Western Tennessee, Western Washington, Utah, and elsewhere have ongoing investigations some of which have resulted in arrests in Nigeria.\u00a0 The Justice Department\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and Office of International Affairs of the Criminal Division provided assistance. District Attorney\u2019s Offices of Caddo Parrish in Shreveport, Louisiana; Harris County, Texas and Los Angeles are handling state prosecutions. Additionally, private sector partners and the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Canadian law enforcement including the Toronto Police Service, the Mauritian Attorney-General and the Commissioner of Police, Polish Police Central Bureau of Investigation, Indonesian National Police Cyber Crimes Unit, and the Royal Malaysia Police provided significant assistance.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis operation, which was funded and coordinated by the FBI, serves as a model for international cooperation against specific threats that endanger the financial well-being of each member country\u2019s residents.\u00a0 Attorney General Sessions expressed gratitude for the outstanding efforts of the participating countries, including law enforcement actions that were coordinated and executed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria to curb business email compromise schemes that defraud businesses and individuals alike.\nVictims are encouraged to file a complaint online with the IC3 at bec.ic3.gov.

BNP Paribas is a global financial institution headquartered in  Paris.   \u00a0   \u201cWe will not tolerate  the misuse of taxpayer funded programs designed to help American businesses,\u201d  said Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division  Stuart F. Delery.  \u201cCompanies that abuse these programs will be held  accountable.\u201d   \u00a0   The United States filed a lawsuit against BNP Paribas in  connection with its receipt of payment guarantees under USDA\u2019s Supplier Credit  Guarantee (SCG) Program.  The program provided payment guarantees to U.S.-based  exporters for their sales of grain and other agricultural commodities to  importers in foreign countries.  The program encouraged American exporters to  sell American agricultural commodities to foreign importers and covered part of  the losses if the foreign importers failed to pay.  The SCG Program regulations  provided that U.S. exporters were ineligible to participate in the SCG Program  if the exporter and foreign importer were under common ownership or control.   \u00a0   The judgment entered by the court resolves the government\u2019s  allegations that, from 1998 to 2005, BNP Paribas participated in a sustained  scheme to defraud the SCG Program.  In furtherance of the scheme, American  exporters and Mexican importers who were under common control improperly  obtained SCG Program export credit guarantees for transactions between the  affiliated exporters and importers.  In some cases, the underlying transactions  were shams and did not involve any real shipment of grain.  BNP Paribas accepted  assignment of the credit guarantees from the American exporters, even though it  knew that the affiliated exporters and importers were ineligible for SCG Program  financing, and a BNP Paribas vice-president, Jerry Cruz, received bribes from  the exporters.  Beginning in April 2005, when the Mexican importers began  defaulting on their payment obligations, BNP Paribas submitted claims to the  USDA for the resulting losses.   \u00a0   On Jan. 20, 2012, Cruz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit  bank fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money  laundering.   \u00a0   \u201cI would like to thank the Department of Justice and the USDA  General Counsel\u2019s office for their collaboration in recovering $80 million under  this judgment,\u201d said Administrator of USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service Phil  Karsting.  \u201cThis illustrates the importance USDA and this administration places  on protecting the integrity of our programs.\u201d   \u00a0   The resolution of this matter was  the result of a coordinated effort among the Commercial Litigation Branch of the  Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, the USDA, the USDA Office of Inspector  General, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Internal Revenue Service  Criminal Investigation.   \u00a0   The lawsuit is captioned  United States v.

In total, more than 30 official members of the LCN, or \"made men,\" were charged in the indictments unsealed today.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the indictments, the LCN operates in numerous cities around the United States and routinely engages in violence and threatens violence to extort money from victims, eliminate rivals, settle vendettas and obstruct justice. In the New York City-area, five LCN families principally operate: the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Luchese families. The Decavalcante family operates principally in New Jersey, while the New England LCN family operates in areas including Providence and Boston. Each LCN family has a hierarchical structure, with an administration comprised of a boss, underboss and consigliere at the top overseeing crews of criminals led by captains, who in turn supervise organized crime soldiers and associates.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Brooklyn, 12 indictments were unsealed today charging 85 defendants from all five New York-based families as well as defendants from the Decavalcante family.

Among other acts of violence, Colombo family acting captain Anthony Russo is charged with the 1993 murder of Colombo family underboss Joseph Scopo during an internecine war among family members. According to court documents, Scopo was shot in the passenger seat of a car outside of his residence in Ozone Park, Queens, N.Y. The Russo indictment also charges numerous crimes of extortion and fraud, including charges related to the Colombo crime family\u2019s alleged long-standing control of Cement and Concrete Workers Union Local 6A, and its alleged defrauding of the City of New York in regard to an annually held feast, the Figli di Santa Rosalia. The indictment is based in part on hundreds of hours of recorded conversations of members and associates of the Colombo family, including meetings of the Colombo family administration.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two of the indictments returned in Brooklyn (United States v. Vernace and United States v. Dragonetti) charge 13 members and associates of the Gambino family, including Bartolomeo Vernace, a member of the current Gambino family administration. The Vernace indictment includes, among others, charges against Vernace in regard to the 1981 double murder of Richard Godkin and John D\u2019Agnese inside the Shamrock Bar in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens. D\u2019Agnese died from a single gunshot to the face and Godkin died from a point-blank gunshot to his chest. The Dragonetti indictment charges numerous acts of extortion, including a conspiracy by the Gambino family to extort a New York City cement manufacturer, as well as various construction companies and sites outlined on the crime family\u2019s so-called \"Construction List.\"   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In nine of the indictments charged in Brooklyn (United States v. Alesi, United States v. Balzano, United States v. Caramanica, United States v. Cicalese, United States v. Colandra, United States v. Gallo, United States v. Gioia, United States v. Messina and United States v. Samperi), members and associates of the Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Decavalcante families are charged variously with racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, extortion, perjury, obstruction of justice, illegal gambling, receipt of stolen property and possession of contraband cigarettes. For example, in United States v. Messina, Bonanno family associate Neil Messina is charged with the murder of Joseph Pistone during a home invasion robbery in 1992. The Alesi indictment charges, among other things, a former member of the Suffolk County, N.Y., Police Department\u2019s Emergency Services Unit with obstructing a state investigation of illegal gambling businesses by tipping off the business to upcoming law enforcement raids. The Cicalese indictment charges three members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association (ILA) with committing perjury during testimony before a federal grand jury investigating organized crime\u2019s infiltration of the waterfront and the ILA.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another indictment (United States v. Depiro), being prosecuted jointly by the District of New Jersey and the Eastern District of New York, charges 15 defendants with various racketeering related crimes, including extortion of members of ILA Local Union 1235 and other New Jersey ILA locals, as well as for acts of illegal gambling through the management of a sports betting operation and a poker club, and\u00a0extortionate collection of credit   related to gambling debts.   Certain defendants, who include numerous current and former officials in local ILA unions based in New Jersey, are alleged to be affiliated with the Genovese family.\u00a0 According to court documents, the Gambino and Genovese families have engaged in a multi-decade conspiracy to influence and control the unions and businesses that work on the New York-area piers.\u00a0 According to court documents, Stephen Depiro managed the Genovese family\u2019s illegal activities on the New Jersey piers, including the Genovese family\u2019s long-standing conspiracy to extort ILA members each year during the Christmas period, when the longshoremen annually receive a\u00a0portion of royalty payments\u00a0paid by shipping companies using the ports of New York and New Jersey.\u00a0 Depiro and others allegedly conspired with his cousin, Nunzio LaGrasso, an associate of the Genovese family and the vice-president of ILA Local 1478 in Newark, to extort ILA members each year.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Manhattan, 26 defendants, primarily from the Gambino family, have been charged in two indictments that include charges related to racketeering conspiracy, murder, narcotics trafficking, extortion, assault, arson, loansharking, illegal gambling, mail and wire fraud, and stolen property crimes. Among the defendants charged are Joseph Corrozo, 69, who has served at times as the Gambino family consigliere; Bartolomeo Vernace, 61, a member of the Gambino family administration, who is also charged in Brooklyn; Gambino family captains Alphonse Trucchio, 34, and Louis Mastrangelo, 66; and Gambino soldiers Michael Roccaforte, 34, Anthony Moscatiello, 40, and Vincenzo Frogiero, 43.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to court documents filed in the Manhattan cases, the criminal conduct allegedly occurred for more than two decades, from the late 1980s to approximately 2010. Gambino associate Todd LaBarca, 39, is charged with the 2001 conspiracy to murder and murder of Gambino family associate Marty Bosshart. According to the indictment, Bosshart was murdered on Jan. 2, 2002, with a single gunshot to the back of his head, and his body was left on the side of the road in Queens. According to court documents, a cooperating witness consensually recorded more than 100 conversations with other members and associates of the Gambino family, including conversations with LaBarca about the murder. In addition, according to court documents, the cocaine and marijuana trafficking involved multiple thousands of kilograms of the illegal drugs.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, an indictment unsealed in Providence charges two defendants - longtime boss of the New England LCN Luigi Manocchio, 83, and LCN associate Thomas Iafrate, 61, - with extortion and extortion conspiracy. The extortion conspiracy allegedly spans almost two decades of illegal activity and involves the extortion of local pornographic bookstores and nightclubs, including the Satin Doll and the Cadillac Lounge, both in Providence.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The charges carry a variety of maximum penalties, up to life in prison on certain charges.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The charges announced today are merely allegations, and defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The defendants charged in each district will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys from each of the respective districts in which the cases were charged, including the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, the District of Rhode Island and the District of New Jersey.

Breuer of the Criminal Division; Richard C. Powers, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI\u2019s Houston Field Office; and Rodney E. Clarke, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation\u2019s (IRS-CI) Houston Field Office.   At the plea hearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Lynn N. Hughes in the Southern District of Texas, ABB Ltd\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, ABB Inc., pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging it with one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to violating these provisions of the FCPA. The court imposed a sentence that included a criminal fine of $17.1 million.   As part of ABB Inc.\u2019s plea, it admitted that one of its business units based in Sugar Land, Texas, ABB Network Management (ABB NM), paid bribes from 1997 to 2004 that totaled approximately $1.9 million to officials at Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), a Mexican state-owned utility company. ABB NM\u2019s primary business was to provide products and services to electrical utilities, many of them foreign state-owned utilities, for network management in power generation, transmission and distribution. In exchange for the bribe payments, according to court documents, ABB NM received contracts worth more than $81 million in revenue. ABB Inc. admitted that the bribe payments were made through various intermediaries, including a Mexican company that served as ABB NM\u2019s sales representative in Mexico on its contracts with CFE. ABB Ltd and ABB Inc. voluntarily disclosed the misconduct to the Department of Justice and have cooperated fully with the investigation.   Fernando Maya Basurto was a principal of the Mexican company. He pleaded guilty on Nov. 16, 2009, to a one-count criminal information charging him for his role in the conspiracy. In his plea, Basurto admitted that while he acted as a sales representative for ABB NM, he conspired with others to make corrupt payments to CFE officials, helped launder the bribe monies, and engaged in a cover up to obstruct the investigations of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   On Nov. 16, 2009, John Joseph O\u2019Shea, ABB NM\u2019s former general manager, was charged in an 18-count indictment with conspiracy, FCPA violations, international money laundering and falsification of records related to his alleged role in the bribery scheme. An indictment is merely an accusation, and O\u2019Shea is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A trial date has not yet been set.   ABB Ltd entered into a deferred prosecution agreement today and agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging its Jordanian subsidiary, ABB Ltd \u2013 Jordan, with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA, and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $1.9 million.   ABB Ltd admitted that ABB Ltd - Jordan agreed to pay kickbacks to the former Iraqi government in connection with contracts to sell vehicles to Iraq under the U.N.\u2019s Oil for Food program. According to court documents, from 2000 to 2004, ABB Ltd - Jordan paid, or caused to be paid, more than $300,000 in kickbacks to the former Iraqi government to secure contracts with the General Company for Electricity Energy Production, the Baghdad Mayoralty, and the State Company Baghdad Electricity Distribution, all of which were regional companies of the Iraqi Electricity Commission, an Iraqi government agency. As a result, ABB Ltd - Jordan and its subsidiary received 11 purchase orders for electrical equipment and services worth more than $5.9 million.   Under the terms of the three-year agreement, ABB Ltd agreed to fully cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign authorities of the company\u2019s corrupt payments and to adhere to a set of enhanced corporate compliance and reporting obligations, which include the recommendations of an independent compliance consultant.   In a related matter, ABB Ltd reached a settlement today with the SEC on a complaint, and agreed to pay more than $39 million in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest and civil penalties.   The case was prosecuted by Senior Trial Attorney Nicola J. Mrazek of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section. The case was investigated by the FBI\u2019s Houston Field Office and the IRS-CI Houston Field Office.

{"id": "12-1195", "title": "Abbott Laboratories Sentenced for Misbranding Drug", "contents": "  Pharmaceutical manufacturer Abbott Laboratories Inc. was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G. Wilson of the Western District of Virginia in connection with its guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the Justice Department announced today.   Abbott, which was ordered to pay a criminal fine in the amount of $500 million, plus a forfeiture of $198.5 million, and $1.5 million to the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, will also be subject to a five-year term of probation.   \u00a0   In May 2012, Abbott pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor for misbranding Depakote in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).   Abbott\u2019s criminal plea related to the misbranding of Depakote by promoting the drug to control behavioral disturbances in dementia patients and to treat schizophrenia when neither of these uses was approved by the FDA.   Under the provisions of the FDCA, a company is required to specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to FDA.   Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for \u201coff-label\u201d uses     \u2013 unless the company applies to the FDA for approval of the additional use.   In an agreed statement of facts, Abbott admitted that from January 1998 to December 2006 it marketed Depakote off-label to treat behavioral disturbances in dementia patients, and from January 2002 to December 2006, Abbott marketed Depakote off-label to treat schizophrenia.   \u00a0   Under the terms of the plea agreement, Abbott agreed to pay the second-largest criminal fine for a single drug, executed a fulsome statement of facts (with exhibits) revealing the extent of its unlawful conduct, admitted that it engaged in misleading statements, and submitted to a five-year term of probation.   Under the terms of its probation, on an annual basis, Abbott\u2019s CEO and board of directors will need to personally certify that the company is complying with the law.   \u00a0   Abbott\u2019s guilty plea was part of a global resolution involving its illegal promotional activity.   Abbott also entered into a civil settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve claims that its unlawful marketing and illegal remuneration practices caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs.   The parallel civil settlement covered a broader range of conduct by Abbott.   The settlement resolved allegations that in addition to off-label marketing for dementia and schizophrenia, Abbott also marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,   post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism.      In addition to the criminal and civil resolutions, Abbott also agreed to enter into an expansive 5-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG) that requires enhanced accountability, increased transparency, and wide-ranging monitoring activities conducted by both internal and independent external reviewers.      \u00a0   \u201cToday\u2019s sentencing confirms that the resolution we reached with Abbott in May is the right result. And it emphasizes the importance of the U.S. government\u2019s coordinated efforts to combat health care fraud.   We expect companies to make honest, lawful claims about the drugs they sell, we will be vigorous in our enforcement efforts when they break the law, and the courts will hold them accountable.\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.  \u00a0   \u201cAbbott unlawfully targeted a vulnerable population, the elderly, through its off-label promotion.   The court\u2019s sentence makes clear that those who engage in such conduct will be prosecuted and held accountable,\u201d said Timothy Heaphy, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia.      This case was handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.   The investigation was conducted by     the Virginia Attorney General\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit; the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation; the FDA - Office of Criminal Investigation; the Defense Criminal Investigative Service; the Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General; the West Virginia State Police; the Office of Personnel Management - Office of Inspector General; the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs Office of Inspector General; the Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and TRICARE Program Integrity.", "date": "2012-10-02T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Civil Division"]}
{"id": "12-585", "title": "Abbott Labs to Pay $1.5 Billion to Resolve Criminal & Civil Investigations of Off-label Promotion of Depakote", "contents": "Global Health Care Company Abbott Laboratories Inc. has pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $1.5 billion to resolve its criminal and civil liability arising from the company\u2019s unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Justice Department announced today.\u00a0 The resolution \u2013 the second largest payment by a drug company \u2013 includes a criminal fine and forfeiture totaling $700 million and civil settlements with the federal government and the states totaling $800 million.\u00a0 Abbott also will be subject to court-supervised probation and reporting obligations for Abbott\u2019s CEO and Board of Directors.\u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s settlement shows further evidence of our deep commitment to public health and our determination to hold accountable those who commit fraud,\u201d said James M. Cole, Deputy Attorney General. \u201cWe are resolute in stopping this type of activity and today\u2019s settlement sends a strong message to other companies.\u201d \u00a0 The FDA is responsible for approving drugs as safe and effective for specified uses. Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a company in its application to the FDA must specify each intended use of a drug. A company\u2019s promotional activities must be limited to only the intended uses that FDA approved. In fact, promotion by the manufacturer for other uses \u2013 known as \u201coff-label\u201d uses \u2013 renders the product misbranded. \u00a0 Abbott has pleaded guilty to misbranding Depakote by promoting the drug to control agitation and aggression in elderly dementia patients and to treat schizophrenia when neither of these uses was FDA approved. In an agreed statement of facts filed in the criminal action, Abbott admits that from 1998 through 2006, the company maintained a specialized sales force trained to market Depakote in nursing homes for the control of agitation and aggression in elderly dementia patients, despite the absence of credible scientific evidence that Depakote was safe and effective for that use. In addition, from 2001 through 2006, the company marketed Depakote in combination with atypical antipsychotic drugs to treat schizophrenia, even after its clinical trials failed to demonstrate that adding Depakote was any more effective than an atypical antipsychotic alone for that use. Illegal Promotion of Depakote to Control Agitation and Aggression in Dementia Patients \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDA approved Depakote for only three uses:\u00a0epileptic seizures, bipolar mania and the prevention of migraines.\u00a0 The FDA never approved the drug as safe and effective for the off-label use of controlling behavioral disturbances in dementia patients. In 1999, Abbott was forced to discontinue a clinical trial of Depakote in the treatment of dementia due to an increased incidence of adverse events, including somnolence, dehydration and anorexia experienced by the elderly study participants administered Depakote. Abbott trained its sales force to promote Depakote to health care providers and employees of nursing homes as advantageous over antipsychotic drugs for controlling agitation and aggression in elderly dementia patients because Depakote was not subject to certain provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA) and its implementing regulations designed to prevent the use of unnecessary medications in nursing homes. Exploiting the fact that certain OBRA provisions did not yet apply to Depakote, Abbott sales  representatives stated that by using Depakote, nursing homes could avoid the administrative burdens and costs of complying with OBRA. \u00a0 Abbott\u2019s off-label promotion of Depakote was multifaceted. The company entered into contracts that provided long-term care pharmacy providers with payments of rebates based on increases in the use of Depakote in nursing homes serviced by the providers. In addition to using its sales force to promote the drug to health care providers and employees of nursing homes, Abbott created programs and materials to train the pharmacy providers\u2019 consultant pharmacists about the off-label use of Depakote to encourage them to recommend the drug for this unapproved use. Under these contracts, Abbott paid millions of dollars in rebates to the pharmacy providers. \u00a0 \u201cNot only did Abbott engage in off-label promotion, but it targeted elderly dementia patients and downplayed the risks apparent from its own clinical studies,\u201d said  Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West.\u00a0 \u201cAs this criminal and civil resolution demonstrates, those who put profits ahead of patients will pay a hefty price.\u201d \u00a0 Illegal Off-Label Promotion of Depakote for Schizophrenia \u00a0 In the agreed statement of facts, Abbott also admitted that from 2001 through 2006, the Company misbranded Depakote by marketing the drug to treat schizophrenia.\u00a0 Abbott funded two studies of the use of Depakote to treat schizophrenia, and both failed to meet the main goals established for the study.\u00a0 When the second study failed to show a statistically significant treatment difference between antipsychotic drugs used in combination with Depakote and antipsychotic drugs alone, Abbott waited nearly two years to notify its own sales force about the study results and another two years to publish those results.\u00a0 During this time, Abbott continued to promote Depakote off-label to treat schizophrenia. \u00a0 \u201c  Today\u2019s settlement demonstrates our continued scrutiny of the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies that put\u00a0profits ahead of patient health,\u201d said U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. \u201cThe FDA will continue its due diligence and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for\u00a0marketing practices that undermine the\u00a0drug approval process.\u201d \u00a0 Criminal Plea \u00a0 Today\u2019s global resolution has criminal, civil and administrative components. First, Abbott has pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor for misbranding Depakote in violation of the FDCA. Under the plea agreement, Abbott will pay a criminal fine of $500 million, forfeit assets of $198.5 million, and submit to a term of probation for five years. In addition, Abbott will also pay $1.5 million to the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit. As a condition of probation, Abbott will report any probable FDCA violations to the probation office, its CEO will certify compliance with this reporting requirement, and its board will report annually on the effectiveness of the company\u2019s compliance program. In addition, Abbott agrees that during the term of probation, the company will not compensate sales representatives for off-label sales, will ensure that continuing medical education grant-making decisions are not controlled by sales and marketing, will require that letters communicating medical information to healthcare providers be accurate and unbiased, and will have policies designed to ensure that clinical trials are approved by the company\u2019s medical or scientific organizations and published in a consistent and transparent manner. Abbott\u2019s guilty plea and sentence are not final until accepted by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. \u00a0 \u201cAs the agreed statement of facts filed in court today demonstrates, Abbott promoted Depakote to control behaviors in elderly dementia and schizophrenia patients without significant evidence of its effectiveness for that use, and even after clinical data established that it was not effective,\u201d said Timothy Heaphy, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. \u201cThe resolution announced today includes a self-policing mechanism by which Abbott\u2019s board of directors will monitor compliance with the law and report any violations, as well as a period of probation and court supervision. We credit Abbott\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and encourage other pharmaceutical companies to impose the similar mechanisms to prevent off-label marketing, which damages health care consumers.\u201d \u00a0 Civil Settlement \u00a0 Under the civil settlement, Abbott has agreed to pay $800 million to the federal government ($560,851,357) and the states ($239,148,643) that opt to participate in the agreement to resolve claims that its unlawful marketing and illegal remuneration practices caused false claims to be submitted to government health care programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and to the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs and the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. \u00a0 The civil settlement addresses broader allegations by the United States that from 1998 through 2008, Abbott unlawfully promoted Depakote for unapproved uses, including behavioral disturbances in dementia patients, psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, conduct disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal, attention deficit disorder and autism. . Some of these unapproved uses were not medically accepted indications for which the United States and state Medicaid programs provided coverage for Depakote.\u00a0 The United States contends that this promotion included, in part, making false and misleading statements about the safety, efficacy, dosing and cost-effectiveness of Depakote for some of these unapproved uses, and claiming use of Depakote to control behavioral disturbances in dementia patients would help nursing homes avoid the administrative burdens and costs of complying with OBRA regulatory restrictions applicable to antipsychotics. \u00a0 The civil settlement also covers allegations that Abbott offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals and long term care pharmacy providers to induce them to promote and/or prescribe Depakote and to improperly and unduly influence the content of company sponsored Continuing Medical Education programs, in violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The claims settled by the civil agreement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability, except to the extent that Abbott has admitted facts in the civil settlement agreement or in the criminal plea and agreed statement of facts filed in the criminal action. \u00a0 The civil settlement resolves four lawsuits pending in federal court in the Western District of Virginia under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery. As part of today\u2019s resolution, the whistleblowers will receive $84 million from the federal share of the settlement amount. \u00a0 Corporate Integrity Agreement \u00a0 In addition to the criminal and civil resolutions, Abbott has also executed a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that Abbott's board of directors review the effectiveness of the company's compliance program, that high-level executives certify to compliance, that Abbott maintain standardized risk assessment and mitigation processes, and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors. Abbott is subject to exclusion from federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches. \u00a0 \u201cAs a result of OIG\u2019s joint investigation with our federal and state partners, Abbott Laboratories will enter one of the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s largest settlements and pay $1.5 billion for unlawfully promoting its drug Depakote, including to nursing home patients with dementia,\u201d said HHS Inspector General Daniel R.

Breuer of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke for the District of Arizona.   According to testimony and evidence presented during the trial, which began June 22, 2010, Lequire has been the treasurer of Patriot Insurance Agency Inc., since 2004. Patriot Insurance was formerly owned by former Arizona Congressman Richard Renzi, and is currently owned by Renzi\u2019s wife. The indictment alleged that from 2006 to 2009 Lequire embezzled insurance premiums held in trust and directed those premiums to Renzi\u2019s personal accounts, and that he conspired with Renzi to do so. The evidence at trial showed that Lequire embezzled $796,000 of the insurance premiums held in trust. Evidence showed that Lequire directed the embezzled funds to Renzi, including, in June 2006, a payment of $263,000 from which Renzi paid federal income tax of more than $200,000, and purchased multiple airline tickets for his family.   The former general counsel of Patriot Insurance, Andrew Beardall, was tried jointly with Lequire on charges that he made false statements to insurance regulators in 2002 and 2003, after Renzi had allegedly engaged in an earlier embezzlement of insurance premiums to fund his first congressional campaign. Andrew Beardall was acquitted by the jury on all counts.   Lequire and Beardall are the second and third of Renzi\u2019s alleged co-conspirators to face trial. In June 2008, a federal jury in Sherman, Texas, convicted business partner James W. Sandlin of two counts of making false statements to a financial institution. Renzi and Sandlin remain charged with extortion arising out of multiple federal land exchange efforts in 2005.   Each count of embezzling insurance premiums carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   The case was tried before U.S. District Court Judge David C. Bury.

In accordance with the President\u2019s Jan. 22, 2009 Executive Order, which called for a review of all Guantanamo detainees and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within a year, the interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force conducted a thorough review of Ghailani\u2019s case. As a result of that review, Ghailani\u2019s case was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution pursuant to the superseding indictment against him in the Southern District of New York.   \"By prosecuting Ahmed Ghailani in federal court, we will ensure that he finally answers for his alleged role in the bombing of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya,\" said Attorney General Eric Holder. \"This administration is committed to keeping the American people safe and upholding the rule of law, and by closing Guantanamo and bringing terrorists housed there to justice we will make our nation stronger and safer.\"   Ghailani was first indicted on Dec. 16, 1998, by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York for conspiring with Osama bin Laden and other members of al-Qaeda to kill Americans overseas and for his role in the Aug. 7, 1998, bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salam, Tanzania, which killed at least eleven people and caused injuries to at least 85 people.   Ghailani has since been charged in several superseding indictments in the Southern District of New York. He currently stands accused in a March 12, 2001, superseding indictment with 286 different counts, including charges related to his role in the murder of more than 200 people in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya, as well as his participation in an al-Qaeda\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0to murder, bomb, and maim U.S. civilians anywhere in the world.

Ghailani departed Africa for Pakistan the night before the bombing.   Ghailani was captured in July 2004. In September 2006, he and several other \"high value detainees\" were transferred to Guantanamo Bay. Ghailani has remained in Defense Department custody at Guantanamo Bay since that time.   On March 31, 2008, the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of the Military Commissions swore charges against Ghailani under the Military Commissions Act for his alleged role in the 1998 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania and for his alleged service to al-Qaeda after the bombing, including serving as a document forger, physical trainer at an al-Qaeda camp, and as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden.   Ghailani was charged with the following substantive offenses: murder in violation of the Law of War, murder of protected persons, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, and destruction of property in violation of the Law of War and Terrorism.

If convicted of all charges against him, he faces a maximum potential sentence of life in prison. According to the indictment, the FARC is an armed, violent organization in Colombia, which since its inception in 1964, has engaged in an armed conflict to overthrow the Republic of Colombia, South America\u2019s longest-standing democracy. The FARC has consistently used hostage taking as a primary technique in extorting demands from the Republic of Colombia.\u00a0 Hostage taking has been endorsed and commanded by FARC senior leadership.\u00a0 The FARC has characterized American citizens as \u201cmilitary targets\u201d and has engaged in violent acts against Americans in Colombia, including murders and hostage taking.\u00a0 The FARC was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State in 1997 and remains so designated. The indictment alleges that Navarrete Beltran was a member of the 1st Front in the FARC\u2019s Southern Block.\u00a0 He was allegedly involved in the hostage taking of three U.S. citizens, Marc D. Gonsalves, Thomas R. Howes and Keith Stansell.\u00a0 These three individuals, along with Thomas Janis, a U.S. citizen, and Sergeant Luis Alcides Cruz, a Colombian citizen, were seized on Feb. 13, 2003, by the FARC after their single engine aircraft made a crash landing near Florencia, Colombia.\u00a0 Janis and Cruz were murdered at the crash site by members of the FARC. According to the indictment, Mr. Gonsalves, Mr. Howes and Mr. Stansell were held by the FARC at gunpoint and were advised by FARC leadership that they would be used as hostages to increase international pressure on the government of the Republic of Colombia to agree to the FARC\u2019s demands.\u00a0 The FARC at various times marched the hostages from one site to another, placing them in the actual custody of various FARC Fronts.\u00a0 At the conclusion of one 40-day march, in or about November 2004, the hostages were delivered to members of the FARC\u2019s 27th Front, commanded by Daniel Tamayo Sanchez, who was responsible for the hostages for nearly two years, after which they were delivered to the FARC\u2019s 1st Front.\u00a0 From approximately October 2006 through July 2008, according to the indictment, Navarrete Beltran and others kept the hostages under the control of the FARC\u2019s 1st Front. In order to prevent the Colombian police and military from rescuing the hostages, he and other conspirators transported the hostages into the Republic of Venezuela. Throughout the captivity of the hostages, FARC jailors and guards, including Naverrete Beltran, used choke harnesses, chains, padlocks and wires to restrain the hostages, and used force and threats to continue their detention and prevent their escape.\u00a0 The indictment also accuses Navarrete Beltran of using and carrying a military-type machine gun during the hostage taking and providing material support and resources to aid in the hostage taking and to aid the FARC.\u00a0 In July 2008, the Colombian military conducted an operation which resulted in the rescue of the hostages. All told, members of the FARC held the Americans hostage for 1,967 days.

{"id": "12-305", "title": "Accused Member of Foreign Terrorist Organization Extradited to United States on Hostage Taking Charges", "contents": "    WASHINGTON \u2013\u00a0Alexander Beltran Herrera, 35, aka Jhon Alexander Beltrain Herrera, aka Rodrigo Pirinolo, an accused member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), has been extradited from Colombia to face hostage taking and terrorism charges in the United States.     \u00a0     The extradition was announced by Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; Ronald C. Machen Jr., U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia; and Dena Choucair, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Miami Division.     \u00a0       Beltran Herrera was extradited from Colombia to the United States over the weekend to face charges in an indictment returned in the District of Columbia on Feb. 22, 2011.  The indictment, which names as defendants 18 members of the FARC, charges Herrera specifically with one count of conspiracy to commit hostage taking; three counts of hostage taking; one count of using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence; one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.       \u00a0     Beltran Herrera is scheduled to be arraigned today at 11:15 a.m. before Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth in federal court in the District of Columbia.  If convicted of all the charges against him, he faces a maximum potential sentence of life in prison.     \u00a0     According to the indictment,     the FARC is an armed, violent organization in Colombia, which since its inception in 1964, has engaged in an armed conflict to overthrow the Republic of Colombia, South America\u2019s longest-standing democracy. The FARC has consistently used hostage taking as a primary technique in extorting demands from the Republic of Colombia.  Hostage taking has been endorsed and commanded by FARC senior leadership.  The FARC has characterized American citizens as \u201cmilitary targets\u201d and has engaged in violent acts against Americans in Colombia, including murders and hostage taking.  The FARC was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State in 1997 and remains so designated.     \u00a0     The indictment alleges that Beltran Herrera was a member of the 27th Front in the FARC\u2019s Southern Block.  Beltran Herrera was allegedly involved in the hostage taking of three U.S. citizens, Marc D. Gonsalves, Thomas R. Howes and Keith Stansell.  These three individuals, along with Thomas Janis, a U.S. citizen, and Sergeant Luis Alcides Cruz, a Colombian citizen, were seized on Feb. 13, 2003, by the FARC after their single engine aircraft made a crash landing near Florencia, Colombia.  Janis and Cruz were murdered at the crash site by members of the FARC.      \u00a0       According to the indictment, Gonsalves, Howes and Stansell were held by the FARC at gunpoint and were advised by FARC leadership that they would be used as hostages to increase international pressure on the government of the Republic of Colombia to agree to the FARC\u2019s demands.       \u00a0       The FARC at various times marched the hostages from one site to another, placing them in the actual custody of various FARC Fronts.  At the conclusion of one 40-day march, in or about November 2004, the hostages were delivered to members of the FARC\u2019s 27th Front, commanded by Daniel Tamayo Sanchez, who was responsible for the hostages for nearly two years, after which they were delivered to the FARC\u2019s 1st Front.  During part of this two year period with the 27th Front, Beltran Herrera was responsible for moving the hostages and keeping them imprisoned.       \u00a0       Throughout the captivity of these three hostages, FARC jailors and guards, including Beltran Herrera, used choke harnesses, chains, padlocks and wires to restrain the hostages, and used force and threats to continue their detention and prevent their escape.   The indictment also accuses Beltran Herrera of using and carrying a military-type machine gun during the hostage taking and providing material support and resources to aid in the hostage taking and to aid the FARC.       \u00a0     \u201cToday\u2019s extradition underscores our resolve to hold accountable all those responsible for this crime and we will not rest until every one of them is brought to justice,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Monaco.     \u00a0     \u201cThis extradition is another step toward justice on behalf of Americans taken hostage and held in chains by a Colombian terrorist organization,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Machen. \u201cWe will not hesitate to bring to justice anyone who targets Americans around the world with violence to advance their political agendas.\u201d     \u00a0     \u201cThis extradition further disrupts and dismantles the FARC, a foreign terrorist organization that has engaged in violent acts against American and Colombian citizens,\u201d said FBI Acting Special Agent in Charge Choucair.\u00a0 \u201cThe outstanding, long term cooperation between the Colombian National Police and U.S. law enforcement has struck another blow to international terrorism.\u201d     \u00a0       This investigation is being led by the FBI\u2019s Miami Field Division.  The prosecution is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anthony Asuncion and Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, and Trial Attorney David Cora from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.       \u00a0     Substantial assistance in the case was provided by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of International Affairs, the Department\u2019s Judicial Attach\u00e9s in Colombia, and the FBI\u2019s Office of the Legal Attach\u00e9 in Colombia. The Directorate of Intelligence (DIPOL) and the Anti-Kidnapping Unit (GAULA) of the Colombian National Police also provided substantial assistance.     \u00a0     The public is reminded that an indictment contains mere allegations and that defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.", "date": "2012-03-12T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["National Security Division (NSD)"]}
{"id": "18-431", "title": "Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan Delivers Remarks at the 35th International Drug Enforcement Conference", "contents": "Remarks as prepared for delivery It is a privilege to speak with you representing the U.S. Department of Justice.\u00a0 As the Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice\u2019s Criminal Division, I oversee approximately 700 attorneys spread across 17 sections and offices, mostly in Washington D.C., but also many stationed in offices around the world.\u00a0 Among other things, prosecutors in the Criminal Division investigate and prosecute transnational organized crime, large-scale international narcotics trafficking, international money laundering, and cyber-related crimes including the use of the dark web to engage in illegal activity.\u00a0 The Criminal Division also houses our Office of International Affairs, which handles all of our foreign legal assistance matters. I am honored today to have the opportunity to speak with this assembly of proud, brave, and accomplished law enforcement officers.\u00a0 This is a critical conference, taking place at this critical time.\u00a0 Today more than ever, we must take stock of not only the successes we have achieved, but more importantly of the hard work that lies ahead of us, as we join together in the ongoing fight against international drug trafficking.\u00a0 Our fight against drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations is the very definition of a fight that transcends borders.\u00a0 It is a shared fight.\u00a0 It is a fight against ever-evolving and innovating threats and methods.\u00a0 And it is a fight in which we as law enforcement collectively can, and must, do better.\u00a0 The costs have never been higher.\u00a0 Today, in the United States, we are facing the deadliest drug crisis in our history.\u00a0 Approximately 64,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016.\u00a0 That was the highest drug death toll \u2013 and the fastest increase in that death toll \u2013 in American history.\u00a0 One American dies of a drug overdose every nine minutes.\u00a0 Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.\u00a0 These numbers are staggering, but their sheer scale can almost numb us to the reality of profound human loss that the drug crisis is causing.\u00a0 Each one of those deaths is a tragedy that reverberates through families and communities, multiplying its corrosive, debilitating effects.\u00a0 Effects that are borne by the dead, for sure, but also effects that are borne, perhaps more painfully, by the living whom they leave behind.\u00a0 These insidious effects are what make the scourge of opioids, including prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic drugs like fentanyl, so dangerous and terrifying.\u00a0 The traffickers who manufacture and distribute the destructive drugs that are ravaging our communities know precisely what they are doing, and they also are only too aware of our efforts to thwart them.\u00a0 That is why drug traffickers are forging underground marketplaces, exploiting the Internet and cryptocurrencies, and simultaneously challenging the stability and security of our financial institutions.\u00a0 Drug traffickers are moving money to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in ill-gotten profits.\u00a0 The task for those of us in law enforcement is to not only stanch the flow of drugs, but also the flow of illicit money.\u00a0\u00a0 Today, I want to talk about that specific problem: the flow of illicit money.\u00a0 Money is the lifeblood of any criminal organization, be it a pill mill, a transnational drug cartel, or a terrorist organization.\u00a0 Money is the very reason that criminal enterprises exist and persist.\u00a0 If we can map out, and stamp out, the financial networks through which the money is moving, we will go a long way in paralyzing these criminal organizations well before we have to endure, first-hand, the destructive effects of their poisons in our communities.\u00a0 How do we stem the tide of illicit money?\u00a0 First, we need to follow not just the money, but also the marketplaces.\u00a0 We need to stay one step ahead when it comes to identifying, regulating, tracking, and seizing the marketplaces that criminals are using for their illegal activities.\u00a0 In this day and age, sophisticated criminals are constantly forging and finding new platforms on which they can buy and sell, recruit, and launder.\u00a0 And naturally, markets that operate in the shadows, hidden from law enforcement, are those most appealing to criminals.\u00a0 We need to bring those shadowy markets into the light. The so-called \u201cdark web\u201d is illustrative of this challenge.\u00a0 It is, by its nature, transnational.\u00a0 It relies on anonymity software that masks the true identities of visitors and their locations.\u00a0 It conceals IP addresses.\u00a0 And because of its hidden nature, the dark web is both a haven and a hub for some of the most prolific drug suppliers and criminal actors across the globe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dark web markets have been used to traffic in deadly drugs, illegal weapons, toxic chemicals, stolen identities, stolen credit cards, child pornography, and even people\u2019s credentials for online accounts.\u00a0 With the click of a mouse, you can have synthetic opioids delivered right to your doorstep.\u00a0 And dark web markets have been used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from illegal transactions.\u00a0 Illicit money flows are finding their way into new corners of the Internet each day. The transnational economy of the dark web demands a transnational response.\u00a0 And we are delivering.\u00a0 Working closely together with our international partners, we have shut down some of the worst offenders on the dark web.\u00a0 Last July, the U.S. Department of Justice executed the largest takedown of a dark web market in history when we seized AlphaBay.\u00a0 The AlphaBay site was the largest criminal marketplace on the Internet, at its peak hosting upwards of 40,000 vendors, 200,000 users, and 220,000 drug sale listings.\u00a0 We have tied purchases made on AlphaBay to multiple overdose deaths across the United States, including the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy whose classmate purchased a synthetic opioid on AlphaBay.\u00a0 With the cooperation of Europol and our host country, the Netherlands, as well as our partners in Thailand, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, we seized AlphaBay\u2019s servers and infrastructure.\u00a0 We froze millions of dollars\u2019 worth of cryptocurrencies that represented AlphaBay\u2019s illicit proceeds.\u00a0 We arrested the site administrator in Thailand.\u00a0 And we are pursuing his and his wife\u2019s assets throughout the world, from Thailand, Cyprus, and Lichtenstein to Antigua and Barbuda.\u00a0 Shortly after the AlphaBay seizure, Dutch authorities, with support from Europol, took down the Hansa marketplace.\u00a0 Hansa was the third largest criminal marketplace on the dark web, also trading high volumes of illegal drugs and goods.\u00a0 The Hansa takedown also was a highly coordinated international operation \u2013 and it was an operation carefully designed to maximize impact by seizing and covertly taking over control of Hansa for about a month.\u00a0 This allowed law enforcement to monitor activities on the platform and collect valuable information on significant law enforcement targets who were using the market for criminal purposes. In January of this year, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions created the Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement team, known as J-CODE.\u00a0 J-CODE reflects the United States\u2019 recognition that a major driver of the increase in opioid overdose deaths is the growing black market trade of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues on the Internet.\u00a0 J-CODE effectively doubles our investment in the fight against online drug trafficking on the dark web, dedicating dozens more FBI agents, intelligence analysts, and professional staff to this long-term effort.\u00a0 And J-CODE puts an emphasis on the need for international coordination and working with our overseas Drug Enforcement Administration and FBI offices to shut down the dark web markets peddling deadly drugs. Just a few months into its creation, we already have seen successes from the work being done by the J-CODE team.\u00a0 Last week, the Attorney General announced initial results of Operation Disarray, which is the J-CODE\u2019s first coordinated law enforcement operation targeting opioid trafficking on the dark web.\u00a0 During the week of March 27, U.S. law enforcement made eight arrests, conducted more than 160 interviews of people who had bought or sold opioids and other drugs online, identified 19 overdose deaths, and executed numerous search warrants, resulting in the seizure of weapons, drugs, and counterfeit currency. Transnational criminals who wish to take advantage of the perceived secrecy of the dark web should beware:\u00a0 law enforcement is smart to your techniques, and we will labor tirelessly across borders, with the full support of our governments, to dismantle your operations.\u00a0 Together, we are inflicting significant blows on dark web markets.\u00a0 And, if we continue to work collectively, we will do more.\u00a0 If we are to keep pace with illegal markets as they shift and grow and change platforms, we too will need to be nimble and adaptive.\u00a0 We need to work together to follow the virtual money flows, while being vigilant as we monitor the ever-fluid landscape and features of cryptocurrencies.\u00a0 We need to ensure that we seize not just end products, but the markets themselves.\u00a0 We must target not just the market creator, but the creator\u2019s assets, enablers, and financial network.\u00a0 The very features of markets on the dark web that make them so attractive to bad actors pose a challenge \u2013 but also an opportunity \u2013 for law enforcement to be smarter, probe deeper, and move faster.\u00a0 How else can we stem the tide of illicit money?\u00a0 We also need to aggressively combat money laundering, using all tools in our law enforcement toolbox \u2013 marrying traditional criminal prosecution with civil forfeiture, financial sanctions, and rigorous enforcement of compliance obligations on financial institutions. As we all know, drug cartels are adept at filtering \u201cdirty\u201d money through various transactions until the funds appear to be \u201cclean\u201d proceeds from legitimate activities, rendering them available for use.\u00a0 This enables criminals to readily mask, move, and access their ill-gotten gains without jeopardizing their illegal activities.\u00a0 They do this through traditional money laundering methods, such as black market peso exchanges, cash couriers, and trade-based money laundering.\u00a0 But they also employ increasingly complex schemes \u2013 utilizing shell companies, or transfers through reputable financial institutions, lawyers, and other professionals that enshroud their illegal proceeds in a veneer of legitimacy.\u00a0 At the U.S. Department of Justice, we seek to leverage the full panoply of tools at our disposal to combat the means and methods of money launderers.\u00a0 That, of course, includes criminal prosecutions of those who violate our money laundering laws.\u00a0 One of our recent investigations, for example, targeted an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering organization largely based in Sinaloa, Mexico.\u00a0 Since at least 2012, the organization allegedly transported massive amounts of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine into the United States.\u00a0 But that was not all; the organization also allegedly smuggled their drug trafficking proceeds from the United States back into Mexico, laundering more than an estimated $100 million dollars.\u00a0 Some money allegedly was laundered through Mexican money exchange houses, while other money allegedly was deposited with U.S. banks and wire-transferred to Mexican accounts controlled by the organization. Our prosecutors brought criminal charges against 15 defendants, including individuals responsible for the movement of the illicit proceeds.\u00a0 To date, eight of those defendants, including the owner of a currency exchange house in Sinaloa and a peso broker operating out of Sinaloa, have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to significant jail time.\u00a0 But the law enforcement tools at our disposal are not limited to bringing criminal charges.\u00a0 Take, for example, the case of Jorge Cifuentes-Villa, who is facing criminal prosecution in the United States.\u00a0 Cifuentes-Villa led a drug trafficking and money laundering organization closely tied to the Sinaloa Cartel and he has been designated by the United States as a Consolidated Priority Organization Target, a designation reserved for the most dangerous and prolific narcotics traffickers.\u00a0 In addition to the criminal charges against Cifuentes-Villa, our prosecutors also brought two multi-million dollar civil forfeiture actions against assets tied to Cifuentes-Villa\u2019s drug trafficking activities.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Treasury levied financial sanctions against Cifuentes-Villa, identifying him as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker, to effectively cut him off from transactions with any U.S. persons or businesses.\u00a0 The path to civil forfeiture of Cifuentes-Villa\u2019s assets began with a vehicle stop in 2009.\u00a0 A single money courier was found in possession of approximately $780,000 in drug proceeds.\u00a0 With that lead, investigators traced money through various companies\u2019 bank accounts that were used to launder on the cartel\u2019s behalf.\u00a0 They traced the money all the way back to transactions eight years before the vehicle stop.\u00a0 Investigators learned that in 2001, a shell company in the British Virgin Islands had received approximately $11 million in funds. \u00a0And that $11 million subsequently was moved through eight brokerage accounts, before it finally landed in two accounts at Wells Fargo Advisors.\u00a0 The tracing showed that the shell company had received the funds from yet another entity in the British Virgin Islands, an entity that was owned by a man who went by the name, Sergio Osuna-Villareal.\u00a0 We identified Sergio Osuna-Villareal as an alias of Jorge Cifuentes-Villa.\u00a0 The investigation revealed that Cifuentes-Villa had transferred more than $10 million in drug proceeds to the shell company as liquidation of the assets of his murdered drug partner.\u00a0 And in 2012, we sought forfeiture \u2013 successfully \u2013 of both the approximately $11 million from the Wells Fargo Advisors\u2019 accounts and a $1.2 million condominium in Miami, Florida that we also traced to Cifuentes-Villa.\u00a0 Those examples underscore the array of tools that we stand ready to deploy against money launderers for drug cartels.\u00a0 With the close cooperation of our international partners, we not only can bring wrongdoers to justice in our courts, but we also can trace where their money traveled and how and when.\u00a0 We can then reclaim their ill-gotten gains, block their assets, and prevent U.S. persons from dealing with them.\u00a0 We also must be forward-leaning in holding accountable the enablers that move or legitimize the funds of drug traffickers.\u00a0 Just as cartels zero in on any weak link in the chain \u2013 by exploiting financial institutions with ineffective anti-money-laundering protocols \u2013 we too will continue to aggressively target financial institutions that turn a blind eye to the mass transit of illicit proceeds through their accounts. To be sure, the examples I have mentioned over the past few minutes barely scratch the surface of the money flows that fuel and refuel the global drug trade.\u00a0 But as with the dark web, the very money laundering tactics that the criminals hope will throw us off should embolden us, focus us, and bring us together.\u00a0 And it is by working together that we are able to most effectively target those illicit proceeds.\u00a0 Money laundering mechanisms are transnational by design.\u00a0 The painstaking work by our agents and prosecutors of mapping out those networks necessitates foreign wiretaps, foreign cooperating sources, and foreign law enforcement surveillance.\u00a0 It calls for timely sharing of international financial intelligence and prompt responses to mutual legal assistance requests.\u00a0 It requires foreign agents to authenticate photographs, wiretaps, and seizure evidence, and provide eyewitness testimony.\u00a0 On all these fronts and more, we can and must better synchronize our efforts.\u00a0 Drug cartels count on our inability to connect the dots across borders and financial institutions.\u00a0 But with concerted international efforts to target illicit proceeds from every legal angle, we can more effectively connect those very dots and unravel the illicit networks driving the drug crisis.\u00a0 Thank you, and I look forward to working with you all. \u00a0 \u00a0", "date": "2018-04-10T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": ["Drug Trafficking", "Opioids"], "components": ["Criminal Division"]}

I will always be grateful to the Attorney General for giving me this opportunity to serve.\u201dDuring Raman\u2019s tenure as Acting Assistant Attorney General, the division has obtained significant results in all areas of financial fraud enforcement.   Under Raman\u2019s leadership, the Criminal Division, working alongside the Antitrust Division, launched a wide-ranging investigation of the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates by multi-national banks around the world.   In addition, the division continued aggressively to investigate the manipulation of the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), charging six individuals at two different financial institutions and reaching a criminal resolution with one financial institution that resulted in the second largest penalty assessed in the department\u2019s ongoing, industry-wide LIBOR probe.   The division further announced charges against or convictions of more than a dozen individuals for FCPA-relation violations, and secured three of the ten largest corporate FCPA resolutions in history.   In addition, Raman oversaw a record-breaking year for health care fraud enforcement in the number of cases filed, individuals charged, guilty pleas secured and convictions obtained at trial.Under Raman\u2019s leadership, the division also made significant strides in money laundering enforcement, including bringing charges, with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan, against Liberty Reserve, one of the world\u2019s largest digital currency companies, and several of its principals, in the department\u2019s largest-ever money laundering prosecution.   The division also continued to emphasize public corruption enforcement, securing several convictions in a wide range of domestic public corruption cases throughout the country, including of former U.S. Congressman Richard Renzi of Arizona, and obtaining separate convictions of several individuals, including a former candidate for U.S. Congress, for violations of federal campaign finance laws.During Raman\u2019s tenure, the division has aggressively pursued cyber crime and intellectual property crimes, and is currently conducting the ongoing investigation of the data breach at Target.   Among other prosecutions, the division, with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Atlanta, secured the guilty plea of an international cybercriminal from Thailand who was responsible for distributing \u201cSpy Eye\u201d malware that infected 1.4 million computers around the world.   The division also charged the first-ever copyright infringement cases involving counterfeit mobile device apps.The division also continued to make great strides in the fight against violent crime, convicting several members of the Los Zetas cartel for the 2011 murder of an American law enforcement agent in Mexico and, just a few weeks ago, securing the conviction of a leader of the Barrio Azteca gang who was responsible for the murder of employees of a U.S. consulate in Mexico.Raman joined the department as a trial attorney in the Criminal Division in 1996.   In 1999, she joined the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Maryland where she served in a number of leadership positions, including Appellate Chief and Chief of the office\u2019s southern division.   She returned to the Criminal Division in 2008, serving first as acting Chief of Staff, and then as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff, until she was named Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division on March 1, 2013.   \u00a0   \u00a0", "date": "2014-02-26T00:00:00-05:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Criminal Division"]}

The SART initiative in Montana is a pilot initiative stemming from the Justice Department\u2019s commitment to build safe and healthy communities in American Indian and Alaska Native communities.\u00a0 SART teams, which could include federal and tribal prosecutors, victim specialists, advocates, tribal agencies and programs, local and federal law enforcement, and health care representatives will meet at least once monthly to address incidences of sexual assault that arise on each reservation and determine the best way to address each one.\u00a0 Each community will compose a team that reflects individual community needs.   Teams will be established on the six reservations under federal jurisdiction within the next six months.\u00a0 The teams will meet monthly to address incidences of sexual assault that arise on each reservation and determine the best way to address each one.\u00a0 The SART team will exist to provide culturally appropriate, timely, coordinated and thorough care to victims of sexual assault.\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cSexual violence against native women is one of the most devastating threats to native communities,\u201d said Acting Associate Attorney General West.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s also an underreported crime.\u00a0 We hope this effort to establish SART teams in each Montana reservation will bring the kind of help, healing and justice to victims of sexual violence that will also strengthen the faith and confidence that native women have in their criminal justice system.\u201d   \u201cI commend the efforts of those who have worked to develop a culturally appropriate sexual assault response team, or SART, that meets the unique needs of the Crow people,\u201d said Crow Tribe Vice-Chairman Jefferson.\u00a0 \u201cMy hope is that with a formalized SART on the Crow Reservation, our mothers and sisters will have access to justice and to recovery from being victims of these types of deplorable crimes.\u00a0 I want to encourage victims, survivors and their family members to come forward, to offer support to each other in the pursuit of justice and healing.\u201d   \u201cTogether we can provide compassionate and innovative care to sexual assault survivors,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Cotter.\u00a0 \u201cI challenge the SARTs to not merely be reactive but also consider ways to intervene before the sexual assault occurs \u2013 through education and outreach.\u00a0 I am hopeful that the presence of SARTs on Montana reservations will provide another tool to improve intervention and care for sexual assault victims.\u201d   American Indian and Alaska Native women are raped at rates higher than any other race. Despite the alarming rates, sexual assault is still the most underreported crime.\u00a0 Under the pilot project in Montana, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office will work with tribal nations to develop culturally appropriate programs and adapt existing response models to create appropriate responses to sexual assault.\u00a0 SART establishes a multidisciplinary team that collaborates on the response to sexual assault cases.\u00a0 The team also adopts coordinated policies and procedures for the investigation, prosecution and provision of services in sexual assault cases.\u00a0 The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Montana will be a resource for specific protocols, training opportunities and model memorandums of understanding (MOUs).   The SART initiative includes collaboration between the Department of Justice, Indian Health Service (IHS), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and other federal agencies in partnership with tribes to increase services to victims of sexual assault in Montana by providing training opportunities for first responders.\u00a0 In April 2012, IHS sponsored a regional SART training in Billings, Mont., with participation from the Crow/Northern Cheyenne Hospital, Rocky Boy Health Clinic, Browning Hospital, Fort Peck IHS Service Unit and Crow Tribal Domestic Violence Program.\u00a0 IHS will host Sexual Assault Examiner training in Billings in July 2012, and will also make forensic equipment, such as digital cameras, available to all IHS and Tribal hospitals in 2012.\u00a0 The Department of Justice and IHS are collaborating on training for evidence collection and with the Department of the Interior on implementation of the Tribal Law and Order Act.   Participating reservations include the Blackfeet, Rocky Boy\u2019s, Fort Belknap, Fort Peck, Crow and Northern Cheyenne.", "date": "2012-06-06T00:00:00-04:00", "topics": [], "components": ["Office of the Associate Attorney General"]}

Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Stuart M. Goldberg, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s Tax Division, and James D. Robnett, Special Agent in Charge of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (\u201cIRS-CI\u201d), announced today that Prime Partners SA (\u201cPrime Partners\u201d) entered into a non-prosecution agreement (\u201cNPA\u201d) with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and agreed to pay $5 million to the United States for assisting U.S. taxpayer-clients in opening and maintaining undeclared foreign bank accounts from 2001 through 2010. The NPA was based on Prime Partners\u2019 extraordinary cooperation, including its voluntary production of approximately 175 client files for non-compliant U.S. taxpayer-clients, and provides that Prime Partners will not be criminally prosecuted. The NPA requires Prime Partners to forfeit $4.32 million to the United States, representing certain fees that it earned by assisting its U.S. taxpayer-clients in opening and maintaining these undeclared accounts, and to pay $680,000 in restitution to the IRS, representing the approximate unpaid taxes arising from the tax evasion by Prime Partners\u2019 U.S. taxpayer-clients.  \u00a0 Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said: \u201cPrime Partners admits to helping its clients conceal their ownership of foreign bank accounts to avoid their U.S. tax obligations. They created sham entities and even counseled their clients to use pay phones and prepaid debit cards to avoid detection of their tax fraud scheme. The resolution of this matter through a non-prosecution agreement, along with forfeiture and restitution, reflects the extraordinary cooperation provided by Prime Partners to our investigation. It should serve as proof that cooperation has tangible benefits. We will continue to pursue financial services firms around the world that help their clients evade U.S. taxes.\u201d \u00a0 Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg said: \u201cThe message is clear to those using foreign bank accounts to engage in schemes to evade U.S. taxes \u2013 you can no longer assume your \u2018secret\u2019 accounts will remain concealed, no matter where they are located. In our ongoing investigations, we will continue to draw on information from a variety of sources and to provide substantial credit to those around the globe who provide full and timely cooperation regarding the identity of U.S. tax cheats and the phony trusts and shell companies they seek to hide behind.\u201d \u00a0 IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge James D. Robnett said: \u201cToday\u2019s NPA signals the continued erosion of the tax secrecy safe havens that helped facilitate this criminal activity at a significant cost to the US taxpayer. IRS-CI is focused on tracking funds of individuals hiding income offshore and will continue to investigate international tax evasion.\u201d  \u00a0 As part of the NPA, Prime Partners admitted various facts concerning its wrongful conduct and the remedial measures that it took to cease that conduct. Specifically, Prime Partners admitted that it knew certain U.S. taxpayers were maintaining undeclared foreign bank accounts with the assistance of Prime Partners in order to evade their U.S. tax obligations, in violation of U.S. law. Prime Partners acknowledged that it helped certain U.S. taxpayer-clients conceal from the IRS their beneficial ownership of undeclared assets maintained in foreign bank accounts by, among other things: (i) creating sham entities, which had no business purpose, that served as the nominal account holders for the accounts; (ii) advising U.S. taxpayer-clients not to retain their account statements, to call Prime Partners collect from pay phones, and to destroy any faxes they received from Prime Partners; (iii) providing U.S. taxpayer-clients with prepaid debit cards, which were funded with money from the clients\u2019 undeclared accounts; and (iv) facilitating cash transfers in the United States between U.S. taxpayer-clients with undeclared accounts.  \u00a0 The NPA recognizes that, in early 2009, Prime Partners voluntarily implemented a series of remedial measures to stop assisting U.S. taxpayers in evading federal income taxes. The NPA further recognizes the extraordinary cooperation of Prime Partners, including its voluntary production of approximately 175 client files for non-compliant U.S. taxpayers, which included the identities of those U.S. taxpayers. \u00a0 As part of the NPA, Prime Partners has agreed to forfeit $4.32 million to the United States, representing a portion of the gross revenues from services that it provided to U.S. taxpayers with undeclared foreign bank accounts from 2001 through 2010. In connection with this forfeiture, Prime Partners has agreed not to contest a civil forfeiture action to be filed by the United States.  \u00a0 The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office entered into the NPA based on factors including: \u00a0 \u00a0 The NPA requires Prime Partners to continue to cooperate with the United States for at least three years from the date of the agreement. In the event that Prime Partners violates the NPA, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office may prosecute Prime Partners. \u00a0 Mr. Kim thanked the IRS for its outstanding work in the investigation of this matter and the Tax Division of the Department of Justice for its assistance in the investigation.  \u00a0 This investigation is being overseen by the Office\u2019s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.

Bibb, 40, of Eagle Pass, Texas; Specialist Paul Escobar, 31, of San Antonio; and Specialist Richard Garcia Jr., 28, of San Antonio.\u00a0        \u00a0       According to court documents filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, between approximately 2005 and 2008, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Army Reserves and the National Guard Bureau entered into contracts with Document and Packaging Broker Inc., to administer recruiting bonus programs designed to offer monetary incentives to U.S. soldiers who referred others to join the U.S. military. In addition, the Army managed its own recruiting programs that offered bonuses to soldiers who referred other individuals to join the Army or the Army Reserves.       \u00a0       Through these recruiting programs, a participating soldier could receive up to $2,000 in bonus payments for every person he referred to join the U.S. military.

According to his plea agreement, Taylor, who was charged separately, admitted that he met Phillips in 2012 and agreed to become Phillips\u2019 prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u00a0 After learning the strict rules that Phillips, Ellis and others used to force and coerce women to engage in prostitution, Taylor began applying the rules himself.\u00a0 Like his co-conspirators, he kept the identification cards of the women in order to keep them from leaving. \u00a0On several occasions, Taylor physically assaulted a woman because she did not earn enough money by engaging in commercial sex acts.\u00a0 He also kept the money that the women earned, and if a woman did not earn enough money, he would order her to continue until she had.\u00a0 Taylor also admitted that he brought an adult woman from Memphis to New Orleans and elsewhere for the purpose of forcing and coercing her to engage in prostitution.\u00a0 The co-conspirators operated out of certain motels, including the Riviera, which generally did not report their activities to the police.\u00a0 The defendants rented multiple rooms at the Riviera where the women would meet prostitution clients and paid higher rates for the rooms because of the increased traffic.

(ACTI Ukraine), a subsidiary of ADM, pleaded guilty in the Central District of Illinois to one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines.   The Department of Justice also entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with ADM in connection with the company\u2019s failure to implement an adequate system of internal financial controls to address the making of improper payments both in Ukraine and by an ADM joint venture in Venezuela.In a parallel action, ADM consented with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)     to a proposed final judgment that orders the company to pay roughly $36.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, bringing the total amount of U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties to be paid by ADM and its subsidiary to more than $54 million.According to the charges, from 2002 to 2008, ACTI Ukraine, a trader and seller of commodities based in the Ukraine, together with Alfred C. Toepfer International G.m.b.H. (ACTI Hamburg), another subsidiary of ADM, paid third-party vendors to pass on bribes to Ukrainian government officials to obtain VAT refunds.   The charges allege that, in total, ACTI Ukraine and ACTI Hamburg paid roughly $22 million to two vendors, nearly all of which was to be passed on to Ukrainian government officials to obtain over $100 million in VAT refunds, resulting in a benefit to ACTI Ukraine and ACTI Hamburg of roughly $41 million.According to the NPA with ADM, a number of concerns were expressed to ADM executives, including an e-mail calling into question potentially illegal \u201cdonations\u201d by ACTI Ukraine and ACTI Hamburg to recover the VAT refunds, yet nonetheless failed to implement sufficient anti-bribery compliance policies and procedures to prevent corrupt payments.In addition to the monetary penalty, ADM and ACTI Ukraine also agreed to cooperate with the department, to periodically report the companies\u2019 compliance efforts, and to continue implementing enhanced compliance programs and internal controls designed to prevent and detect FCPA violations.The agreements acknowledge ADM\u2019s timely, voluntary and thorough disclosure of the conduct; ADM\u2019s extensive cooperation with the department, including conducting a world-wide risk assessment and corresponding global internal investigation, making numerous presentations to the department on the status and findings of the internal investigation, voluntarily making current and former employees available for interviews, and compiling relevant documents by category for the department; and ADM\u2019s early and extensive remedial efforts.The department acknowledges and expresses its appreciation for the cooperation and assistance of German law enforcement authorities, which, in a parallel investigation, reached a resolution with ACTI Hamburg regarding its role in the bribery scheme.In addition, the department acknowledges and expresses its appreciation for the significant assistance provided by the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement.This ongoing investigation is being conducted by the FBI.

Acevedo\u2019s primary role in the scheme was to pay kickbacks and bribes to patient recruiters of LTC and Professional.\u00a0 As part of this role, Acevedo and others would distribute cash to patient recruiters in exchange for providing patients to LTC and Professional, as well as prescriptions, plans of care (POCs) and certifications for medically unnecessary therapy and home health services for Medicare beneficiaries.\u00a0 Acevedo and her co-conspirators would use these prescriptions, POCs and medical certifications to fraudulently bill the Medicare program for home health care services, which Acevedo knew was in violation of federal criminal laws.\u00a0   From approximately September 2007 through June 2012, LTC and Professional submitted approximately $41 million in claims for home health services that were not medically necessary and/or not provided.\u00a0 Medicare actually paid approximately $27 million for these fraudulent claims.\u00a0 Acevedo was part of an overall scheme that fraudulently billed Medicare more than $74 million.   This case was investigated by the FBI and HHS-OIG and was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, under the supervision of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida.\u00a0 This case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Joseph S. Beemsterboer of the Criminal Division\u2019s Fraud Section.

Chaudhary, 37, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Court Judge Denise Page Hood in the Eastern District of Michigan to one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud. Barrett, 72, and Cartier, 50, each pleaded guilty before Judge Hood to one count of conspiracy to receive kickbacks. At sentencing, scheduled for Sept. 23, 2010, Chaudhary faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Barrett and Cartier, scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 16, 2010, face a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   According to the plea documents, Chaudhary was a physical therapy assistant and began working for All American Home Care Inc. and other affiliated entities (All American). All American purported to provide home health services, including physical therapy services, to Medicare beneficiaries. Chaudhary admitted that he signed documents, including therapy visit and revisit notes, that purported to document home health visits to Medicare beneficiaries that were then billed by All American to Medicare. Chaudhary admitted in court documents that a large majority of these home health visits never occurred. Chaudhary also admitted that he was paid approximately $45 by the owners of All American for each therapy visit form he signed. According to court documents, Chaudhary signed documents used to justify approximately $747,282 in home health claims by All American for patients he either never saw or for whom home health services were medically unnecessary. Chaudhary admitted that he knew that the files he helped falsify were used to justify fraudulent billings to Medicare.   Chaudhary also admitted in court documents that he laundered money on behalf of co-defendant Hassan Akhtar. According to court documents, Akhtar wrote checks to Chaudhary from All American\u2019s bank accounts and directed Chaudhary to cash the checks, retain a small portion of the cash for himself and return the rest of the cash to Akhtar. Chaudhary admitted in court documents that he knew the All American accounts from which the checks were drawn contained proceeds of the fraudulent scheme described above. According to court documents, Akhtar\u2019s and Chaudhary\u2019s purpose in orchestrating these transactions was this to conceal the disbursement of funds from the fraudulent scheme to Akhtar.   According to plea documents, Cartier was the owner and/or operator of an adult foster care facility (AFC), Hilltop Estates Inc. Cartier admitted that he received kickbacks from Mohammed Shahab, the owner and/or operator of several home health agencies (HHA), in exchange for Medicare patient referrals. In 2008, Cartier accepted $5,000 from an individual acting on Shahab\u2019s behalf in exchange for allowing Shahab to bill Medicare for home health services purportedly provided to residents at Cartier\u2019s AFC. Cartier admitted that from April 2009 through August 2009, he accepted $2,000 in cash per month from Shahab in exchange for allowing Shahab to bill Medicare for home health services purportedly provided to residents at his AFC. Cartier admitted he knew that Shahab would bill Medicare for home health physical therapy visits purportedly made to the Medicare beneficiaries at Cartier\u2019s facilities.   Over the course of the conspiracy, Cartier referred 13 patients to Shahab\u2019s HHAs. During the time Cartier participated in the scheme, Shahab\u2019s HHA, Patient Choice Home Healthcare, submitted claims for $159,531 in improper benefits from the Medicare program.   Barrett, the owner and/or operator of an AFC and two room and board facilities, admitted in court that she also solicited and received kickbacks from Shahab. Barrett admitted that Shahab offered to pay Barrett in exchange for the opportunity to bill Medicare for home health physical therapy sessions purportedly provided to beneficiaries residing at Barrett\u2019s AFC and room and board facilities. Barrett admitted that she agreed to provide Medicare beneficiary referrals to Shahab\u2019s HHAs in exchange for payments. Barrett admitted in court that she knew Medicare was billed for the patients she referred.

The settlement announced today resolves allegations that Adventist Health improperly compensated physicians who referred patients to the White Memorial facility by transferring assets, including medical and non-medical supplies and inventory, at less than fair market value.\u00a0 Additionally, Defendant White Memorial paid referring physicians compensation that the United States contended was above fair market value to provide teaching services at its family practice residency program.\u00a0 The United States alleged that these payments violated the Anti-Kickback Act and Stark Statute, and by extension, the False Claims Act.\u00a0\u00a0 Approximately $11.5 million of the settlement will be paid to the U.S. Government, most of which will benefit the Medicare Trust Fund.\u00a0\u00a0 The remaining $2.6 million will be paid to California\u2019s Department of Health Care Services.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   The Anti-Kickback Act prohibits offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and/or other federally-funded programs.\u00a0\u00a0 The Stark Statute prohibits a hospital from submitting claims for patient referrals made by a physician with whom the hospital has an improper financial arrangement.\u00a0\u00a0 Both the Anti-Kickback Act and Stark Statute are intended to ensure that a physician\u2019s medical judgment is not compromised by improper financial incentives and is instead based on the best interests of the patient.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   \u201cKickbacks and other unlawful financial arrangements cost taxpayer dollars and undermine the integrity of medical judgments,\u201d said Stuart F.

Wagner, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California.   \u201cPayouts made by hospitals and clinics \u2013 as the government alleged in this case \u2013 raise substantial concerns about physician independence and objectivity,\u201d said Ivan Negroni, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services San Francisco region.\u00a0 \u201cTaxpayers and vulnerable patients rightfully expect such payments to be investigated and pursued.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0   The settlement announced today resolves a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of California under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act.\u00a0\u00a0 These provisions allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery.\u00a0\u00a0 The whistleblowers in this case will collectively receive $2,839,219 of the recovery.\u00a0 The lawsuit is captioned U.S. ex rel. Hector Luque et al. v. Adventist Health et al. No. 2:08CV1271 (E.D.

This resolution is part of the government\u2019s emphasis on combating health care fraud and another step for the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) initiative, which was announced by Attorney General Eric Holder and Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in May 2009. The partnership between the two departments has focused efforts to reduce and prevent Medicare and Medicaid financial fraud through enhanced cooperation. One of the most powerful tools in that effort is the False Claims Act, which the Justice Department has used to recover more than $10.3 billion since January 2009 in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs. The Justice Department\u2019s total recoveries in False Claims Act cases since January 2009 are over $14.2 billion.   This case was handled by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of California, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.

Ciraolo of the Justice Department\u2019s Tax Division.\u00a0 Gideon Misulovin, 58, whose last known address was in New York City, was extradited from Greece to the United States to serve his 10-year prison sentence.\u00a0 He has been incarcerated in the United States since his return on July 16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On March 7, 1996, a jury convicted Misulovin of conspiracy to impede and impair the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the ascertainment and collection of more than $6.5 million in federal motor fuel excise taxes, wire fraud and money laundering stemming from a scheme to conceal the unpaid diesel fuel excise taxes from state and federal tax authorities. During trial, Misulovin was free on $500,000 bail and attended each day of the trial.\u00a0 He failed to appear in court March 4, 1996, for the parties\u2019 closing arguments.\u00a0 U.S. Senior District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of the District of New Jersey in Newark issued a warrant for his arrest.\u00a0 On June 25, 1997, Judge Debevoise sentenced Misulovin in absentia to serve 10 years in prison and a three-year term of supervised release, and to pay a $150,000 fine.\u00a0 The court also ordered Misulovin to pay restitution in the amount of $200,000 to the United States and $100,000 to the state of New Jersey. The evidence at trial established that from 1988 through Jan. 31, 1993, Misulovin and his co-conspirators sold untaxed diesel fuel in a series of paper transactions using wholesale companies.\u00a0 Some of the companies were shams and called \u201cburn\u201d or \u201cbutterfly\u201d companies.\u00a0 As part of the scheme, the sham company would assume the federal and state tax liability and then vanish, allowing the conspirators to keep the excise taxes they collected from truck stops and service stations. The case, part of a then-nationwide motor fuel excise tax enforcement effort, was investigated jointly by the Motor Fuel Task Force and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of the District of New Jersey.\u00a0 In an effort to infiltrate the bootleg gasoline industry, task force agents set up an undercover business called RLJ Management that competed directly with the defendants\u2019 operation. At the conclusion of the undercover operation, in November 1992, federal agents seized Misulovin\u2019s assets, including approximately $70,000 in cash from his residence and $277,000 from his business bank account.\u00a0 Misulovin\u2019s co-defendant and co-conspirator, Arnold Zeidenfeld, of Brooklyn, New York, pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified for the government.\u00a0 Gurmit Singh and Manbir Singh, of Matawan, New Jersey, who operated truck stops in southern New Jersey, also pleaded guilty for their roles in the scheme. In August 2014, based on an Interpol Red Notice, Misulovin was detained in a Greek airport using an alias and traveling with an Israeli passport.\u00a0 He was subsequently arrested pursuant to a U.S. request for a provisional arrest, and after contested extradition proceedings, was found extraditable in 2015. \u00a0 The task force included attorneys from the Tax Division and agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation and Examination Divisions, the FBI, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the New Jersey State Department of Taxation and Finance.\u00a0 Seth D.

{"id": "09-1056", "title": "AGCO Corp. to Pay $1.6 Million in Connection with Payments to the Former Iraqi Government Under the U.N. Oil-For-Food Program\r\n", "contents": "  WASHINGTON \u2013 AGCO Corp., a U.S. corporation based in Duluth, Ga., has agreed to pay a $1.6 million penalty for illegal kickbacks paid to the former government of Iraq, Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division Lanny A. Breuer announced today.   AGCO agreed to the payment as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. The matter is part of the Department\u2019s ongoing investigation into the United Nations (U.N.) Oil-for-Food Program.   A criminal information was filed today against AGCO\u2019s wholly owned U.K. subsidiary, AGCO Ltd., in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charging AGCO Ltd. with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. AGCO, an international manufacturer of agricultural machinery and equipment, has acknowledged responsibility for improper payments made by its subsidiaries\u2019 officers, employees and agents to the former government of Iraq in order to obtain contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture to sell agricultural equipment and parts. The deferred prosecution agreement requires that AGCO and its subsidiaries, including AGCO Ltd., cooperate fully with the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing investigation.   According to the agreement and the information, between 2000 and 2003, AGCO Ltd. paid approximately $553,000 to the former government of Iraq to secure three contracts by inflating the price of the contracts by 13 to 21 percent before submitting the contracts to the U.N. for approval. The company concealed from the U.N. that the price of the contracts had been inflated and then used the additional funds to pay a kickback to the former Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture.   In recognition of AGCO\u2019s thorough review of the improper payments and the company\u2019s implementation of enhanced compliance policies and procedures, the Justice Department has agreed to defer prosecution of AGCO Ltd. for three years. If AGCO and AGCO Ltd. abide by the terms of the agreement for the three-year term, the Justice Department will dismiss the criminal information at that time.   The Oil-for-Food Program was established by the U.N. to enable Iraq to sell its oil for humanitarian purposes in the context of an extensive international sanctions regime. The program mandated that the proceeds of oil sales be deposited in a U.N. bank account and that those proceeds be used by the Iraqi government only to purchase humanitarian goods and services approved by the U.N., such as food, medicine, and other necessary infrastructure items. Beginning in 2000, the former government of Iraq began requiring companies wishing to sell humanitarian goods to government ministries to pay a kickback, often mischaracterized as an \u201cafter sales services fee,\u201d to the government in order to be granted a contract. The amount of that fee was usually 10 percent of the contract price. Such payments were not permitted under the Oil-for-Food Program or other sanction regimes then in place.   In a related matter, AGCO reached a settlement today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which it has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $2.4 million and approximately $16 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest relating to 16 Oil-for-Food contracts.   Also today, AGCO agreed to a disposition resolving an ongoing investigation by the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime. The charges were based on two Oil-for-Food contracts executed by AGCO\u2019s Danish subsidiary, AGCO Danmark A/S. AGCO agreed to pay approximately $630,000 in disgorgement of profits in connection with those charges.   AGCO will pay a combined total of more than $20 million in fines, penalties, and disgorgement of profits in connection with the cases brought by the Department of Justice, the SEC and the Danish State Prosecutor\u2019s Office.   This case is being prosecuted by Fraud Section Senior Trial Attorney Stacey Luck.   The Justice Department acknowledges and expresses its appreciation of the significant, ongoing assistance provided by the Enforcement Division of the SEC in the Department\u2019s Oil- for-Food investigations and the Danish State Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Serious Economic Crime.
